Introduction to Model Organisms (160493)
Craig Hunter
2017 Fall (2 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: n/a
Model organisms are embedded in our scientific culture, from text books on the discovery of genetic material, to mod-encode genome projects. This quarter course is a means to formally introduce an enormously successful experimental scientific approach that has revealed uncountable new biological mechanisms for the last 70 years. Students in this class will engage in hands-on learning exercises to become familiar with commonly used model organisms. They will learn about the genesis of each model system and compare and contrast the features and available experimental approaches that govern whether a particular organism is an appropriate model for different biological phenomena.
Course Notes: Limited to first year graduate students in the MCO Ph.D. program. Additional Course Attributes:
