         Biomedicine plays a profound role in shaping social phenomena. It informs how we conceptualize ourselves, how we care for others, the ethical dilemmas we confront, and our global political engagements. Drawing on readings and insights from anthropology, science and technology studies, and the medical humanities, students will explore the socio-political, moral, and existential issues associated with biomedicine, while also developing theoretical and methodological tools they can use to conduct their own person-centered investigations of afflictions and therapies in the US and around the world. By engaging ethnographic case studies on topics such as abortion, addiction, organ transplants, disability, and infectious disease, students will develop an understanding of how social and political processes shape health and disease outcomes, as well as how culture is revealed and produced in the ways people pursue and receive medical care. This is a junior tutorial.
