         The major goal of conservation biology is to preserve and recover populations and ecosystems through evidence- based assessment, analysis, and management. This course will integrate ecological and evolutionary theory into resource management, economics, sociology, and political science to explore conservation strategies, the value of ecosystem services, and the challenge of decision-making under conflicting interests. Case studies will include major contemporary issues such as the preservation of foundational taxa (e.g., corals on tropical reefs, trees in rainforests), management of genetic diversity, defining recovery targets, and ecosystem-based management. A local field trip within New England will be arranged.
