Comparisons in form and content, allowing for a wide variety of interpretations and methods. Composers to be studied range from Homer and Virgil to Mozart and Monteverdi to Wagner and Borodin. Special topics include romantic heroism, from Achilles in the ancient Greek "Song of the Ethiopians" to Violetta in Verdi's "La Traviata". Besides pre-set readings and audio/video assignments, students will be encouraged to develop their own material for study and their own comparisons. No prerequisites in language or music skills. Relevant points of interest include genres that transcend classical notions of epic or opera, such as Korean "p'ansori" and medieval French "chantefable".
