             This course teaches students to generate, develop and realize ideas that change how we think and live. Students are invited to imagine far-ranging ideas with special attention to mindful aesthetic process and form. Individual ideas are complemented by a collective maker experience aimed to teach collaborative creator skills and openness to public dialog. Students form teams to design unusual beverage experiences through ice and wood design. These designs form the props of student-designed Drink Opera, a kind of sensory improvisation illustrative of behavior-altering idea exchange, which students present in a public setting at the end of the semester. Students spend a weekend in Maine working with wood artists and learn from entrepreneurs, bar tenders, scientists and artists. Case study and conceptual readings will complement student idea exploration.
Course Notes: Open to all students with passionate curiosity (any concentration) - no prior creator experience necessary.
