Freshman Seminar 50D
"Where are you from?" Ancestry in the age of genomics (202998)
David Haig
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0300 PM - 0459 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
A human interest in ancestry and kinship is found in most cultures. This interest is not a construct of the modern age, but recent advances in genetics can now provide a wealth of previously unavailable information about our genetic descent. The seminar will discuss examples of what genetics can tell us about where we are from and address the kinds of questions genetics can answer and the kinds it cannot answer. What should we conclude when cultural tradition and genetics tell different stories? Are genetic answers relevant or irrelevant to competing cultural narratives of identity? Is the question "Where are you from?" an invitation to explore our common humanity amid diversity or is it a microaggression that constructs barrriers between us?
