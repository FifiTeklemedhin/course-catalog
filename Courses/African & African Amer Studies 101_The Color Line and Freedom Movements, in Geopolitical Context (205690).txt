This seminar examines American racism and anti-racism, by situating this history in a deeply international context. We will seek thematic throughlines, from transnational abolitionism and Atlantic emancipations; to US imperialism in the Caribbean, amidst homefront Jim Crow; to the internationalist affinities of movements from Civil Rights to Black Lives. Throughout we will interpret how U.S. racial formations and contestations, have been consistently entangled with global war, empire, diaspora and solidarity -- from Civil War to World War, Cold War to Terror War. Our study will juxtapose scholarly, creative and primary sources -- to analyze together the American racial state's domestic and foreign policies, as well as the efforts of critical intellectuals and popular movements. We will touch on topics such as U.S. white-supremacist and anti-racist responses to Haitian self-determination, and African decolonization; African-American soldiers' wartime encounters with insurgent Mexico, WWII Europe, Vietnam and Iraq; efforts to link U.S. racial politics with comparable inequalities in the UK, Brazil, India, South Africa and Palestine; and consider worldviews expressed by leading strategists of U.S. foreign policy as well as those of artistic, religious, Pan-African, queer, Black feminist and labor activists across regions and over decades.
