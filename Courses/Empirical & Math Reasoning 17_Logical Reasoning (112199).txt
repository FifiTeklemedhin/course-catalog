           The concepts and principles of symbolic logic: valid and invalid arguments, logical relations of statements and their basis in structural features of those statements, the analysis of complex statements of ordinary discourse to uncover their structure, the use of a symbolic language to display logical structure and to facilitate methods for assessing arguments. Analysis of reasoning with truth-functions ("and", "or", "not", "if...then") and with quantifiers ("all", "some"). Special attention will be given to the norms underlying valid reasoning, to applications of formal techniques to "arguments in the wild", and to the wide variety of non-logical ways that ordinary discourse can succeed at being (illicitly) persuasive.
Class Notes: Weekly quizzes and "argument labs" will be held Fridays 11-1 and 1-3. Students are required to select one of these time periods when registering
for the course.
