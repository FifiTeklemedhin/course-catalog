         Does flexible work lead to liberation or loss of identity? Does it bring self-fulfillment or insecurity? This course will examine the ways in which workers' connections to employers, occupations, and locations have become more fluid and transitory, and we will critically engage in the debate about the social and personal consequences of such "flexible" labor. We will investigate what flexibility means in a variety of economic sectors and occupations, exploring the experience of work in the contemporary political economy with an eye toward both its liberating and oppressive potential. How do different forms of work affect our personalities, life circumstances, and connections to each other? What is meaningful work? Our approach will be rooted in the crucial question of workers' control over their own labor and we will explore this through case studies. What does flexibility mean for tech workers in Silicon Valley and bankers on Wall Street? Throughout the course we will pay particular attention to occupations where social class is ambiguous or problematic, leading us to the question: what does it mean to be a worker versus a professional? In examining the labor process under modern capitalism we will focus on both its structural aspects as well as on culture, ideology, and identity. And we will examine how the workplace intersects with gender, the family, and one's experience outside of the factory gate or office cubicle. We will read prominent social theorists along with a variety of ethnographic accounts which in different ways seek to elucidate the conditions of work under modern capitalism.
