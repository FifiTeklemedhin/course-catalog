         What explains the meteoric shift in favor of same-sex marriage in recent years? Why do some countries ban head scarves? Can public policy change deeply-held cultural values? This course draws on multiple approaches to the study of identity -- gender, sexuality, race, religion, and others -- to examine its role in politics. It explores the evolution of policies related to group rights and equality across advanced democracies. Topics include multiculturalism, LGBT rights, affirmative action, and gender quotas.
