Contemporary politics is haunted by the specter of populism. Yet what exactly is populism? Is it a genuine pathology facing democratic polities? Or is it a meaningless term that has been invented to impugn legitimate democratic movements? This course makes use of the tools of history and political theory to explore these and other questions, with the aim of achieving a better handle on the populist phenomenon. We will examine the rich contemporary literature on the relationship between populism and democracy. We will also delve into American history and consider whether there has in fact been a lasting populist undercurrent in American politics. This is a junior tutorial.
