         This course examines the sources and consequences of inequality in Japanese society. We consider how the lives of ordinary people were affected as Japan moved through decades of high economic growth followed by the "lost decades" of economic recession. The course uses ethnographies, historical accounts, survey data, film, and other sources. In analyzing inequality based on social class, gender, and ethnicity in Japan, students will learn how processes of inequality operate in similar or distinct ways from other societies. The course provides historical background and does not require prior knowledge of Japan.
