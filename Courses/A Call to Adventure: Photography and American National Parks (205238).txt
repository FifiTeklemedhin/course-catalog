2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Both photography and the American National Park system were conceived in the 19th century, and have grown up alongside each other. This studio photography class will look at the National Parks as sites of artistic production that have shaped our cultural imagination for the last 100 years. The purpose of this seminar is to familiarize you with the role of artistic inspiration in the formation of the park system, and to critically analyze the ways in which geological, political and social conditions give rise to modes of artistic production. The class will familiarize you with photographic strategies that have evolved alongside the Parks—starting with 19th Century Geological Photographic Surveys of the West, to upheaval in the 1970s that gave rise to New Topographics, New Social Documentary Photography and ecological art—in order for you to shape your own photographic exploration of place. We will also explore the cache of clichéd imagery that Parks generate in order to ask the question, "How can one generate a meaningful visual response to iconic and mythic collective experiences?" You will learn to use a camera in order to strategize your own approach to place. Students will choose local sites and will generate an artistic response to that place throughout the course of the semester. This photographic exploration will be supported conceptually by readings, slide lectures, field trips, technical instruction, and group critiques of student work.
