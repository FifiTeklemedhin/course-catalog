An economist and a humanist, together with other professors from the natural and social sciences, analyze conceptual and policy-relevant issues from viewpoints of their respective disciplines. For example, how do we measure inequality, and at what point does it become problematic (and how do we know)? How then should it be addressed (e.g., tax code, minimum wage)? What role does, and can, education play? What are the best policies to confront job losses from technology? What does "sustainable growth" mean? The goal is not merely to examine four intertwined issues –growth, technology, inequality, and education –but also to understand the distinct concerns and methods of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.
Students who wish to receive economics concentration or secondary field credit must enroll in Econ 1000a. Econ 1000a and b are differentiated only by their sections and by some assignments. The common classes are the same for all students. Econ 1000a, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
For Economics concentrators: Economics 10a. For others: Ec 10a or completion of General Education EMR requirement or equivalent.
