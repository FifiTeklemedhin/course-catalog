Humanity and its Challenges: Systems Thinking and Engineering Design Solutions (204471)
Cherry Murray
Vikram Mansharamani
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0830 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
As citizens in a rapidly changing world facing increasingly complex challenges, the skills that tomorrow's leaders will need are increasingly crossing disciplinary silos. Yet humanity's most pressing problems are interconnected, involve competing interests, and defy such simplification. Reductionist approaches focused on linear understanding must be balanced against the integrative logic of systems-oriented thinking. This course is designed to give students an appreciation for the complexities of today's most intractable problems, and in so doing, help students develop a framework necessary for navigating the world they will face.
