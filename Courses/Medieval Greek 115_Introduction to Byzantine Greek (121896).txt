Medieval Greek 115
Introduction to Byzantine Greek (121896)
Alexander Riehle
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1000 AM - 1129 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course provides an introduction to the language of late antique and Byzantine Greek texts. This "Medieval Greek" should not be understood as a clearly definable stage in a linear development from Ancient to Modern Greek, but rather as a conventional designation of a broad continuum of linguistic registers, ranging from highly archaizing usages ("Atticism") to the so-called vernacular. In the surviving texts, these registers may vary significantly, depending on the author and his (or rarely, her) audience, the genre and other contextual factors. Through a close reading of representative literary and "sub-literary" texts from various periods and genres, the course intends to give students a first impression of this diversity and multi-layerdness of Greek writing in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. Although the main focus will be on linguistic analysis, we will also discuss related aspects of composition and style.
