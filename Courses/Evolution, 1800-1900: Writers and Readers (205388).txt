On the Origin of Species had just appeared, in November 1859, and already commentators throughout Europe pointed out that what Darwin had said was not that new. Scholars now agree that, in the course of often unproductive arguments on this front, "forerunners" were often made to say things they never meant. Nevertheless, it is the case, that from the last decades of the Eighteenth Century, throughout Europe and the United States, a variety of authors –philosophers, naturalists, printers and publishers, journalists, clergymen –engaged in debates on life, its origin and possible changes or transformations. The class will put the so-called Darwinian revolution in context by examining and discussing the larger conversations of the time on this issue, examining both well-known thinkers (Lamarck, Darwin, Haeckel), and ones who are currently less-known. In the course of our work, we will challenge in particular the view that educated and popular opinion had to wait for the big men of science for enlightenment on nature's processes.
