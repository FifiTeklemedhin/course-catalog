Deforestation, overpopulation, pesticide use, toxic oceans, endangered species, global warming. How are we to make sense of the many environmental problems facing the Earth today? Although the sciences provide a factual account of environmental threats and ways of countering them, scientific facts seem not to be enough, since artists, writers, filmmakers, and even scientists find themselves turning again and again to their imaginations to respond to the environmental predicaments of industrial society. They may be doing what English Romantic poet Percy Shelley powerfully described 200 years ago as an essentially human and creative impulse: "to imagine that which we know." How, then, have creative minds imagined –in essays, books, and movies –the very idea of nature, the place of humans in it, and their power to change the environment? In this course, we will consider both the possibilities and the problems that writers and filmmakers have imagined about human interactions with the natural world. We begin with the nineteenth century, when Romantic writers were urgently contemplating the meaning of nature in an age of increasing industrialization. In the first unit we interpret "Walking" (1862), the naturalist Henry David Thoreau's seminal nature essay that imaginatively explores the concept of wildness. In the second unit we will critically compare the literary approaches of two popular books by scientists –Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), and James Lovelock's The Revenge of Gaia (2006). And in the final unit we will examine the techniques of documentary movies about relationships between humans and animals –Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man (2005) in which the filmmaker takes issue with the self-proclaimed environmentalist Timothy Treadwell who strove to protect bears in the Alaskan wilderness, and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's Blackfish (2013) in which she delivers a brilliant polemic against the Sea World corporation and its treatment of captive killer whales.

Class, Race, and Space in Bost
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
This course explores the interplay between the physical spaces of American cities and the class and racial identities of urban residents. We ask how spaces, from sidewalks to public housing to university campuses, shape residents' images of themselves and their neighbors. Course readings and assignments emphasize the contested nature of political decision-making processes, focusing on debates among politicians, courts, university officials, and neighborhood groups. We begin by examining a pioneering work in the field of urban studies: Jane Jacobs's The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961). Jacobs vehemently critiqued programs for urban renewal and instead celebrated the vitality of social spaces found in older urban neighborhoods such as Boston's North End and New York's Greenwich Village. In the second unit, we compare academic and popular discussions of the role of the government in promoting residential segregation, examining portions of Richard Rothstein's bestselling The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America (2017). We consider style and the use of evidence in different forms of non- fiction writing as we explore this controversial topic. We build on the skills developed in the first two units in a final research paper that considers Harvard's own history of class, race, and space. Students first explore scholarship regarding "town-gown" relations more generally and then conduct original research regarding a key episode in Harvard's interactions with neighboring residents in Boston or Cambridge.
