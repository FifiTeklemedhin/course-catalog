case, those who hold power cling to it at all costs, while those who feel oppressed or excluded fight to attain some power of their own. In most societies, power is concentrated in the hands of a select few, and even in the world's democracies, many citizens continue to feel powerless—the playthings of some distant and shadowy elite, or of grand political and economic forces beyond their control. In this course, we will consider some of the fundamental questions regarding the nature of power: Does power always have to be "power-over," with one group dominating the rest? Or is it possible for groups of people to generate "power-with," empowering themselves to act in pursuit of shared goals? Is power ultimately synonymous with violence, or wealth, or political authority? Is it possible to exercise power over culture and ideas in addition to people and resources? As the course progresses, we will converse with the dissident writers who confronted the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, examine the student- led movements that toppled dictatorships in the 21st, and consider what these episodes can teach us about the techniques of domination and resistance in democratic societies like our own. To that end, we'll conclude the course by testing our theories of power against some recent and acclaimed documentaries, from films like Jehane Noujaim's The Square and Laura Poitras' Citizenfour, which give us front row seats to history-making acts of revolution and civil disobedience, to polemical works like Ava DuVernay's 13th and Craig Ferguson's Inside Job, which aim to expose the workings of power in relation to racial and economic inequality.

governance from historical and artistic representations of it? This course will examine what U.S. democracy looks like—its electoral mechanics, its collective bodies, its buildings, and its personality—when brought to life in campaign commercials, architecture, and films. We will ask what these representations of government suggest about the political ideals they ostensibly embody. How do the depictions of government in these works shape our understanding of the possibilities and constraints of democratic action? In what ways can citizens participate (or not) in these figurations of government? Our first unit will explore presidential television advertisements from the 1952 to the recent salvos of the 2008 campaign. With an eye to uncovering how their narratives, imagery, rhetoric, and stagecraft imply particular assumptions about democratic governance, we will examine how such commercials ask us to consent to a particular version of "government by the people." In our second unit we will study the architecture of the Massachusetts State House (which we will examine in person) and a few of Washington, D.C.'s federal buildings—the Capitol, the White House, the Supreme Court Building, and the Pentagon. Analyzing architectural drawings, photos, paintings, and online tours of these buildings, we hope to uncover not just the symbolism of their styles but the effect that their shape and allocation of space have on individual and collective behavior. We will compare, in our final unit, conceptions of government in several conspiracy- theory films: The Manchurian Candidate, All the President's Men, JFK, Wag the Dog, and State of Play. We will consider how each film reflects fears commonly held at the time of its creation—fears of communist infiltrations, presidential abuses of power, or corporate manipulations of government officials, among others. How do the respective fears depicted in these films challenge our definitions of democracy? How do such narratives reinforce our relationship with government?

Class Notes: "Food . . . is not art. . . . A good risotto is a fine thing, but it isn't going to give you insight into other people, allow you to see the world in a new way, or
force you to take inventory of your soul." So William Deresciewicz, in an opinion piece for the New York Times, dismisses our society's rising fascination with food over the last few decades, from the explosion of cookbooks, food blogs, and bestselling histories of cod, salt, and sugar, to the glut of cooking shows, many featuring contestants dueling in gladiatorial kitchens. Like the ancient Romans, we have become obsessed with food. But is Deresciewicz right to say that food won't give us insight into ourselves? Is it not possible that by examining what scholars and commentators call "foodways"— the various forces involved in how different cultures produce, buy, sell, and consume food—we learn much about ourselves and the world? In this course we will be guided by the maxim of famous anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss, "food is good to think," as we contemplate various foodways from a number of illuminating perspectives. In our first unit we delve into what makes food "disgusting" or "natural." How do we categorize edible material as polluting or pure? What even counts as food in different societies? In our second unit, we explore what we can learn about food and culture by looking at successful cooking shows produced in different countries, for instance, Top Chef, Iron Chef, and The Great British Bake Off. What do these shows as cultural artifacts tell us about the values that are celebrated or perpetuated through food? Our third unit will consider global trends of commodities, economics, and food ethics. For this unit students will conduct a research of food practice centered in some way on Annenberg. Can we define what a dining hall does, or should do? How has the ritual and practice of dining changed over time at Harvard? Along the way, we will read classic works, from theories of food by anthropologists Mary Douglas, Jack Goody, and Michael Dietler, to ideas about food as a medium for relationships between people, including the relationships that make up a vast food economy of farms, factories, supermarkets, and our tables, as seen in the writing of novelists, essayists, and food journalists as diverse as Marcel Proust, David Foster Wallace, Wendell Berry, M.F. K. Fisher, and Michael Pollan.
