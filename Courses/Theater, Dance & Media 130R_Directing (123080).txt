A directing class for directors interested in theater, television and film, as well as for actors, dramaturgs, and designers investigating all aspects of theater. The class accommodates beginning to advanced levels of directorial work. Live video camera work for the stage will also be part of the course. Through constant scene work, the course examines the directorial tools of text analysis, staging, design, and working with actors. The central focus is on how to tell a story clearly, effectively, and how a director's personal experiences or passions can creatively shape their work. Students may bring in video or film scenes as part of the class work.
