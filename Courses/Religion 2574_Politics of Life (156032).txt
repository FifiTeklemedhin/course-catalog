In this advanced seminar, we will analyze conceptualizations of "life itself" in contemporary political philosophy, paying especial attention to the legacy of religious ideas on contemporary "secular" theory.
In contemporary philosophical discussions, conceptualizations of life are prominent in two significantly different areas of scholarship: "biopolitics" and the "new materialisms" (or "material ontologies"). Both of them inherit a notion of life marked by the emergence of biology as a field set apart from religion or metaphysics. Discussions of biopolitics focus on how regimes of power control human bodies. "New materialisms" seek to draw attention to the vitality of matter, claiming that contemporary scholarship has focused exclusively on the power of human actions, especially language. But what is the relationship, if any, between these two recent areas of debate? What conceptions of society and corporeality inform them? And what makes philosophical discussions of the meaning of life particularly important in the 21st century?
