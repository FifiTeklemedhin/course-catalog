          This course will explore the relationship between climate, environment and human evolution. How did hominins and other mammals adapt to global cooling and grassland expansion? Is there any correlation between climate and the adaptive radiation that produced multiple Australopithecine lineages and the genus Homo? How might the environments of Eurasia have influenced the dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa? And how are anthropogenic climate change and environmental degradation affecting human health, subsistence and conflict today? What is the future of our species?
