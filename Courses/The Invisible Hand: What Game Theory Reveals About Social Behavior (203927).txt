The Invisible Hand: What Game Theory Reveals About Social Behavior (203927)
Bethany Burum
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 40
What happens when the benefits of one strategy depend on the strategy chosen by another? From doing favors to driving on the right side of the road, this interdependence characterizes much of human social behavior, and game theory is the tool designed to reveal what results. This course will draw on models from game theory and evolutionary dynamics to explain some of the most puzzling aspects of our psychology, including why we speak indirectly, why people end up in feuds over trivial resources, and where our moral intuitions come from. No prior knowledge of game theory or evolutionary dynamics is required.
