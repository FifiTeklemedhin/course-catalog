Research at the Harvard Forest: Global Change Ecology-Forests, Ecosystem Function, the Future (112349)
David Foster
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 11
Global change ecology is the line of scientific inquiry that integrates the responses of organisms, ecosystems, and their environments with changes in human activity and climate. This seminar will focus on state-of-the-art research, tools, and measurements used in evaluating and anticipating global change through ongoing studies at the Harvard Forest's 3,500-acre outdoor laboratory in Petersham, MA. Students will explore the key role that forests play in climate control and develop the necessary skills to present and discuss the ecological evidence for past and future global change. The seminar consists of four weekend-long field trips (Friday evening-Sunday) to the Harvard Forest, where students will visit various long-term ecological experiments, use long-term and real-time datasets to understand biosphere-atmosphere interactions, and discuss key scientific findings. The course will highlight integrated faculty studies of land-use history, forest dynamics, atmospheric exchange of carbon and water, plant phenology, invasive plants and pests, and the impacts of climatic warming on complex ecosystems. Transportation, accommodations, and meals at the Harvard Forest will be provided. A final, on-campus mini-symposium will give students an opportunity to present what they have learned in a public forum.
