Molecular and Biophysical Mechanisms in Signal Transduction focuses on the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that underlie signal transduction and other essential biochemical processes. Major topics incluce biochemical thermodynamics and conformational equilibria, the structural basis for signal transduction, receptor pharmacology and allostery, and enzymatic mechanisms in signaling. The course includes both content lectures and research frontiers seminars focused on current research in signal transduction with a particular emphasis on application to therapeutically relevant pathways.
