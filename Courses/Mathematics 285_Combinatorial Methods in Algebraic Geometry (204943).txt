         This course gives examples of two central ways in which combinatorial structures arise in algebraic geometry. The first is via "tropicalization"- replacing a variety of dimension n with a real manifold of dimension n that encodes a stratification into subvarieties. For instance, we discuss how to encode toric varieties by lattice polyhedra, nodal curves by graphs, degenerations of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces by polyhedral decompositions of tori and spheres. Then we use combinatorial techniques to extract information about the original object, The second way is via representation theory. For instance, the representation theory of the symmetric group, and thus partitions, play a fundamental role in Hurwitz theory. We will give a gentle introduction to the tools involved, such as Fock space. These ideas have particularly beautiful application in the enumeration of covers of P^1 or an elliptic curve.
