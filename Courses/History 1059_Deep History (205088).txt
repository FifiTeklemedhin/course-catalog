 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
          Transcending disciplinary boundaries, "Deep History" brings the entirety of the human past together into a single historical narrative. Lectures and discussions enable students to anchor their understanding of the human past in tangible remainsâ€”a tool, a piece of ceramic or rock art, a shell-bead. These, in turn, provide models for students as they research objects of their own choosing. Spanning the world and traveling from the deep past to the present, this course offers students a chance to engage with a new kind of historical identity and provides a counterbalance to the short-termism common in our public sphere.
