          This course is an intensive study of Shakespeare's dramatic works from the point of view of the actor. It is important to remember that Shakespeare's verse dramas were written to be performed and that only when they are approached this way - as playable, theatrical texts - do they have their maximum impact. Through text analysis, scene study, vocal work, and acting exercises we attempt to find, not only the meaning, but the music and theatrical power of Shakespeare's words.
Course Notes: Enrollment will be determined by an audition during the first class meeting. Additional Course Attributes:
