This course will prepare students to engage with anthropology not only as an academic discipline but as a potential tool and application for understanding various development program interventions, evaluations and collaborations. By focusing on current development issues/concepts (e.g. social protection; resiliency; gender; education and learning; and conflict transformation) this course will get students to analyze critically various development projects in addition to examining knowledge, power and practice in the cultural world of development professionals. Both qualitative and quantitative methods will be taught and used throughout the course.
