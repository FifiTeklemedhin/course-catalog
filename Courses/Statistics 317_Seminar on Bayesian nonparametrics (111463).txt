       The Ultimate Inference Bake-off... with Bayesian Nonparametrics!This course is fundamentally about gaining a deep understanding of state-of-the-art inference techniques for probabilistic models, with the goal of also thinking of ways to address their shortcomings. Since probabilistic models are obviously a very large area, we'll focus on Bayesian Nonparametric models. After a brief overview of Bayesian Nonparametric models we'll begin our ultimate inference bake-off: starting with the tried-and-true techniques and going to the current state-of-the-art. Along the way, we'll learn what works when, and where the gaps are. Students will complete several programming assignments, lead discussion on papers, and complete a substantial final project.
