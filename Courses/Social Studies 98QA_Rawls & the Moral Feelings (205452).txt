This tutorial will use the Harvard archive of the philosopher John Rawls to uncover his work on a complex theory of moral feelings in the 1950s. This moral theory would come to underpin Rawls's political philosophy in his famous text A Theory of Justice, yet most of the relevant documents are unpublished. After learning approaches for archival research from this case study, students will write a historical research paper using other materials in the Rawls archive -- or another archive, with permission of the instructor. This is a junior tutorial.
