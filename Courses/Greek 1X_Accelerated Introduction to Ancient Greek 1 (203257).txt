           Greek 1x is the first half of a two-semester intensive introduction to ancient Greek. Participants will begin to gain direct access to the literature and culture of Greece through its writings at a more rapid pace than Greek 1. The specific dialect studied is that of Athens, which is the language of, e.g., Plato, Euripides, and Thucydides, as well as the basis for the language of the New Testament.
Course Notes:
Recommended Prep:
Students wishing to continue after Greek 1x should proceed to Greek 2x, which completes the accelerated introductory sequence and prepares students for Greek 10. No auditors. May be taken Pass/Fail.
Prerequisites: None, but since 1x is an intensive course, students should feel confident of their ability to learn a highly inflected language relatively quickly, taking into account the demands of other commitments. Students
