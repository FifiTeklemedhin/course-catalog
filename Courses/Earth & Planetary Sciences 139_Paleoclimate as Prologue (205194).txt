         In this course we will explore and quantitatively assess major past events in Earth's history involving temperature, sea level, and the cryosphere and compare these with respect to our understanding of current and predicted changes. The class will take a 'raw-data' and 'first-principles' approach to the subject: raw data in the sense that we will work with quantities that are directly observed in order to make estimates and draw inferences, and fi?rst principles in the sense of focusing on basic mechanisms. Working backward in time, topics will include modern temperature variability, the Little Ice Age, Medieval Warm Period, abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial, Last Interglacial sea level, glacial cycles, permanent 'El Nino', and past changes in ocean circulation.
