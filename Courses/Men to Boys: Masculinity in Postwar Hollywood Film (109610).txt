Men to Boys: Masculinity in Postwar Hollywood Film (109610)
Michael Bronski
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 25
This survey course examines the changing images of masculinity in Hollywood films from 1950 to the present. We will use the films, critical readings, feminist theory, film theory and primary source materials to chart the enormous changes in how postwar culture conceptualized "manhood" and "masculinity." Beginning with post-World War II films such as "The Men," and then covering Vietnam films and sports films such as "Rocky" and "Raging Bull" we will end with popular comedies celebrating male immaturity of Judd Apatow. We will be analyzing the films in the economic, political, sociological, and psychological context in which they were made and to which they were responding.
