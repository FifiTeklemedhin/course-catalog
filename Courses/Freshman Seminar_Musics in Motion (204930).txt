Music is on the move, traveling across geographical boundaries to reach new and broader audiences. As a result, most locales today support a broad array of musics with different histories and styles. This seminar will take a comparative approach to the sounds, settings, and significances of a cross-section of music traditions and their interactions. Along the way, we will play the Senegalese sabar drums, dance the tango, and attend two world music concerts. We will discuss music's mobility through human migration and virtual channels; the transformative role of musical performance in ritual, politics, and the marketplace; and the many ways in which music shapes individual and collective memory and identity. If music is a medium of expression through which we pray, protest, remember, and relax, it can also provide a lens through which we can understand the most deeply felt aspects of human experience and mark changes in the world around us.
Recommended Prep:
Requirements:
The class will include two hands-on music sessions and also attend two world music concerts. This seminar does not require a knowledge of Western musical notation. But it is hoped that each participant will bring to the class some knowledge of and experience with at least one musical tradition they have experienced and found meaningful in their own life, whether they are an expert participant or a casual listener.
