         Is it possible for a person to know and do "the good"? Can we trust in the law, the will, or faith to make us good? These questions were central to Luther's reforms. Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, who spent their formative years in a Lutheran context, would also engage these questions in explicit, implicit, and deeply critical ways. Later, theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer drew from all of these authors in order to rethink his own ethics of political resistance to fascism. This course will trace these questions across these five authors in critical conversation with contemporary ethical theorists.
