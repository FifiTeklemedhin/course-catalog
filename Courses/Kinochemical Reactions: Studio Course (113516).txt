         This course is essentially the continuation of 150A. Students will re-write, produce, and direct the scripts that were developed during the fall term. Emphasis will be given to directing actors, spatial reconnaissance of shooting locations, production design, sound design, and re-making/re-mapping through editing. Completed films (edited, mixed, color graded) are required by the end of the term. Collaboration between students, and crew rotation is a must.
