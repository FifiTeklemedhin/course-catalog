             This course examines geographical, political and literary border-crossings within German-speaking Europe. We will explore how the notion of border crossings has been articulated in the small form, including poetry, the short story, the newspaper article, film, and visual art. Topics include literary projections of America (Kafka, Kracauer), exile communities before and during the Second World War (Zweig, Sebald), the Berlin Wall and German division (Grass, Schlöndorff, Schneider), multiculturalism in contemporary Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (Özdamar, Zaimoğlu), the current refugee crisis (Erpenbeck), and multilingual experimentation (Herta Müller, Pastior, Tawada).
