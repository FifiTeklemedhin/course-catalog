         Independent Study is designed to provide credit for field research, academic study not available in regular course work, or practice or performance in the arts. What distinguishes a suitable project is the application of analytical skills to the object of Independent Study. Any sophomore, junior, or senior whose previous record is satisfactory may petition to undertake Independent Study for non-letter-graded credit. Students may access the petition for Independent Study on the Office of Undergraduate Education website.
