What are the sources of power in the ancient world? What distinguishes various configurations of political, social, or economic power from one another? How important is human biology in the creation and maintenance of power? What role does the environment play?These questions motivate our seminar. In each session, we consider one aspect of power (political, social, economic, environmental, or physical) and begin with an ancient text. An article employing a more traditional philological or historical approach to that evidence then follows. From this foundation, we will move to methods used in the social and pure sciences to study the same aspect of power. Methods studied derive from anthropology, (osteo)archaeology, botany, chemistry, demography, economic theory, genetics, geography, mathematics, medicine, political science, sociology, and statistics.Each class session will ask not only how these derived methods benefit (or fail to benefit) our study of ancient history but also, where applicable, the ways in which these studies integrate textual and material cultures to produce historical analysis.
