Charles Langmuir
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0230 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
How igneous rocks form and reveal the processes and fluxes involved in the circulation of the solid Earth. The course begins with the essential elements of igneous petrology, rock description and nomenclature, mineralogy, phase diagrams, processes of melting and crystallization, trace elements. We then consider the formation of igneous rocks at modern igneous settings, spreading centers, convergent margins and ocean islands. We conclude with investigations of igneous phenomenon of the past, such as large igneous flood basalt provinces, anorthosites, komatites and the igneous history of the Moon.
