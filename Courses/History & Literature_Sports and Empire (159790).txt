Why do American sports differ from the rest of the world? How did soccer become a global sport? What explains the distribution of cricket and rugby around the world? Are sports a form of cultural imperialism? This course will explore these questions (and more) as we examine the connection between sports and imperialism. Themes we will cover include race, class, gender, professionalism, and commercialization. Readings include rule books, novels, poems, periodicals, memoirs, and films.
