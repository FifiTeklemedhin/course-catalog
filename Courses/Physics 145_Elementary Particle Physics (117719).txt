         Introduction to elementary particle physics. Emphasis is on concepts and phenomenology rather than on a detailed calculational development of theories. Starts with the discovery of the electron in 1897, ends with the theoretical motivation for the Higg's boson, and attempts to cover everything important in between. Taught partly in seminar mode, with each student presenting a classic paper of the field.
Recommended Prep: Physics 143a. Physics 143b or equivalent is useful. Additional Course Attributes:
