The second term of intermediate Swedish takes as its theme migration and identity from a Swedish perspective. Through literature, film and media, students will explore how emigration and immigration has helped shape Swedish identity and culture, both historically and in our own times. Particular emphasis will be placed on gaining a deeper understanding of today's diverse, multi-ethnic Sweden and the debates, growth and challenges to which immigration has given rise in recent years.
