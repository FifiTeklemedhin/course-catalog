MWF 0900 AM - 0959 AM n/a
Chemistry 20/30 is an integrated two-semester sequence that prepares students to study chemistry and other physical sciences, whereas the Chemistry 17/27 sequence focuses on application of organic chemistry concepts to the life sciences. Either sequence satisfies the organic chemistry requirement for medical school and the chemistry concentration. The content of Chemistry 17 is accelerated and overlaps with topics from both Chemistry 20 and 30. Students may not count both Chemistry 17 and 20 toward the degree. However, Chemistry 27 and Chemistry 20/30 cover different material, so students may choose to take Chemistry 27 after completing the 20/30 sequence.
Open to students who scored 4 or 5 on the Chemistry Advanced Placement Examination, or who successfully completed Life Sciences 1A or Life and Physical Sciences A. Others should contact the instructor to discuss their preparation.

            Chemical principles that govern the processes driving living systems are illustrated with examples drawn from biochemistry, cell biology, and medicine. The course deals with organic chemical reactivity (reaction mechanisms, structure-reactivity relationships), with matters specifically relevant to the life sciences (chemistry of enzymes, nucleic acids, drugs, natural products, cofactors), and with applications of chemical biology to medicine and biotechnology. An understanding of organic reactions and their "arrow" pushing mechanisms is required.
