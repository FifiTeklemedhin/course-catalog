Philosophy 139
Later Heidegger (156116)
Sean Kelly
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
A close reading of selected texts from Martin Heidegger's later work, starting from the period after the publication of Being and Time. Heidegger's later work rejects the humanism of his own earlier period as well as the humanist existentialism made famous by Sartre. In doing so, it attempts to gather and preserve meaningful possibilities of existence in our "destitute times." Topics will be chosen from among Heidegger's encounter with various figures in the history of philosophy as well as with such topics as thinking, poetry, gods, works of art, science, technology, and things.
