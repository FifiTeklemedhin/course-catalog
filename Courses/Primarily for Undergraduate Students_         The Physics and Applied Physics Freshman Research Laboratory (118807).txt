This year's Freshman Seminar will enable students with musical training to bridge this knowledge with Physics, Mathematics, software and hardware via experimentation with sound and music. Teams will be guided by faculty, staff and a practicing software entrepreneur. The course will be accessible to students with an interest in science/engineering and who currently play a musical instrument, at least at an elementary level.
Course Notes: The instructor will contact selected students for an interview by phone or Harvard email so remember to check your Harvard email. Please make sure
