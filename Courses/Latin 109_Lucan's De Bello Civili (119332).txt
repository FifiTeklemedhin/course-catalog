           Careful reading in Latin of Lucan's De Bello Civili, his strange and fascinating historical epic on the conflict between Pompey and Caesar, and on the beginning of the end of the Roman republic. Particular topics to be examined include the poem's political context, its place within the Roman epic tradition, and its powerful use of rhetoric, parody, and the grotesque.
