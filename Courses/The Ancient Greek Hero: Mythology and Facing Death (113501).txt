The Ancient Greek Hero: Mythology and Facing Death (113501)
Gregory Nagy
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap:
MW 1200 PM - 1259 PM n/a
This course explores some of the greatest works of ancient Greek literature in English translation, while concentrating on a central problem for humanity: how to face death? For the Greeks, a special way to address this problem was to think long and hard about what they called "heroes" in their myths. The purpose of the course is to extend that kind of thinking to the present. There are no examinations, and assignments are limited to a series of five short pieces of creative writing. Each assignment invites students to engage in personal reflections on the meaning of life and death in the light of what we read in Greek literature about the ordeals of becoming a hero.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.
