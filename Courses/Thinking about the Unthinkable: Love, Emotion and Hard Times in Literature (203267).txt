This course is about the struggle to express and respond to complicated, often painful experiences. We describe some of these as unspeakable or unthinkable, but somehow they must be expressed in language, because language of one kind or another is all we have. The source of what is unspeakable can vary, from forbidden love and the suppressed feeling to situations of oppression, trauma and violence. Do not expect an atmosphere of constant gloom (in fact we laugh quite a bit in this class), but do expect to look closely at texts and other examples of art to help us figure out how writers and artists manage at the edges of what can be expressed. We'll explore some moments in world literature centered largely on young people in difficult situations, starting in the mid- eighteenth century, when writers became obsessed with the feeling response as a measure of virtue (often manifested in tears) and continuing with Goethe, Blake and others. Oddly enough, earthquakes figure prominently in some of the works of this period, shaking not only the ground but also ideas about the world. In the second half of the course, we'll turn to the form of the memoir. What can we decide about inexpressibility and memory, the recollection of experience? We'll start with Frederick Douglass's memoir of slavery, supplemented by excerpts from other works. We will spend another few weeks on memoirs of the Holocaust by people who were young in those years, and we'll look at more recent writers on trauma and memory. Some of the supplementary readings will come from today's headlines. Again, all will not be darkness and gloom. Hovering over the course is the spirit of Anne Frank and the sense that even in the darkest narratives, the flame of life can continue to burn, and that words can recover their power, especially for the young.
