What is space? What is time? How have humans viewed these over the years? How are the views of these shaped by our environments and cultures? We often employ spatial metaphors for social situations –e.g. "they're
very close," or "they split apart." It seems that as concepts of space change, and our horizons are broadened, these changes are reflected in a shift in cultural awareness. In this seminar, we explore concepts of space in a number of cultures: Pacific Islanders, Western Apache, Brazilian Rain forest, to name a few. The human mechanism of spatial cognition is examined, along with the reuse of these parts of the mind in future planning, memory, and imagination. As the seminar progresses, we focus in on the shifts of the concepts of space in Western culture –starting with ancient Greeks and Egyptians. We examine the period when astronomy and astrology were practiced side-by-side, and then turn to the world of Dante Alighieri, where space was married to concepts of morality and culture. Finally, the development of physics and astronomy from Galileo to the present has seen seismic shifts in the concept of space-time. These in turn were reflected in broader cultural shifts.
