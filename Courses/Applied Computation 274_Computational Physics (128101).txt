           The course will describe major computational techniques for fluid flows, as described by the Navier-Stokes equations of continuum mechanics. In addition, the course will cover a new class of mesoscale techniques for complex flows and soft matter systems, which do not fit within the continuum Navier-Stokes description. The latter encompass a broad class of flowing materials of special interest to micro-nano engineering and biology.
