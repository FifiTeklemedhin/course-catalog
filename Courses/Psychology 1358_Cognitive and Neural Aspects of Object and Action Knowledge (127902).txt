         Knowledge of objects and actions encompasses their perceptual and motor properties as well as more abstract properties such as information about their function (e.g., what they are used for, the goal of an action). How is this knowledge represented and organized in the brain? We will read and discuss key papers on object and action representation and critically evaluate results from behavioral, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and computational studies. The seminar will provide a critical review of the current literature and identity important challenges that await future research.
