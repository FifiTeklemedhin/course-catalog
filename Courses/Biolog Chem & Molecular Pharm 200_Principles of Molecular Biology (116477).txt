Principles of Molecular Biology is a course organized around the Central Dogma of Biology with presentations covering fundamental aspects of DNA and RNA structure, their function and their interactions with proteins. The course opens with a discussion of the physical and chemical properties that drive the interactions of proteins with nucleic acids. This is used as a basis for understanding the material presented in the subsequent five modules, which cover DNA replication, DNA repair, gene regulation, transcription and translation. Throughout this course an emphasis will be placed on how the structure of small molecular machines (proteins) define their function in the processes and pathways that are introduced.
Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Medical School as BP 723.0.
