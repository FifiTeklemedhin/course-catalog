Evolutionary Medicine: Comparative Perspectives on Medical, Surgical and Psychiatric Illness (205490)
Barbara Natterson-Horowitz
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Heart attacks, breast cancer, anxiety and eating disorders occur across the animal kingdom. Taught by a physician, the course explores the species-spanning and evolutionary origins of medical, surgical, and psychiatric illnesses. A
'mini-medical school' format will be used to introduce students to ten forms of human pathology emphasizing the typical mechanistic explanations of disease causation offered by physicians followed by in depth evolutionary analyses. Both physical and mental illnesses will be explored across the animal kingdom with a special focus on how emerging awareness of psychopathology in animals can alter the perception (stigma) and treatment of mental illness in human beings.
