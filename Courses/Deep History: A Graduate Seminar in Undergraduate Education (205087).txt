R 0200 PM - 0459 PM 15
The goal of this graduate seminar is to develop an introductory undergraduate lecture course on "deep history," an approach that combines findings drawn from archaeology, anthropology, and history into a single historical narrative spanning the entirety of the human past. The seminar will have two main elements. The first features readings in the historical, archaeological, and anthropological literature that offer devices for framing the deep human past (e.g. universal history, four-field anthropology, and "Big History"). The second is dedicated to developing and work shopping graduate-student-designed teaching modules that will form the core of a spring 2018 course taught by Prof. Smail.
