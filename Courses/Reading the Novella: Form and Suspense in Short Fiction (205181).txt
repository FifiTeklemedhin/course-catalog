Reading the Novella: Form and Suspense in Short Fiction (205181)
Jonathan Bolton
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Short enough to read in a single sitting, but more complex and absorbing than short stories, novellas give us some of our most intense reading experiences. Indeed, many of the enduring classics of world literature, from Melville's Benito Cereno to Chekhov's The Duel, take advantage of the novella's compression and acceleration of plot–– features that are also suited to horror, mystery, and other forms of "genre" fiction. In this seminar, we will read some of the great masters of the novella form, including Anton Chekhov, Henry James, Leo Tolstoy, Alice Munro, and Katherine Anne Porter, as well as other examples from around the world, including Eastern Europe, China, and Japan.
Readings of 50-125 pages a week (all of it in English) will allow us to work closely with some classics of modern fiction, going down to the level of word choice and sentence structure, but we'll also consider the way authors build and sustain suspense, the different forms of narrative resolution, and other questions of plotting and structure. We will also talk about how to get the most out of your weekly reading experiences —I'll ask you to set aside solitary time for your reading each week and, as far as possible, to read each novella in just one or two sittings. You'll keep a reading journal, including 2-3 pages of unstructured writing each week; a number of creative assignments and a final paper will help you understand the choices made by authors as they shape their stories for this most demanding and exciting of fictional forms.
