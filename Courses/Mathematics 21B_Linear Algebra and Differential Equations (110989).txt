Mathematics 21B
Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (110989)
Oliver Knill
2018 Spring (4 Credits)
Instructor Permissions: None
Schedule: TBD Enrollment Cap: n/a
Matrices provide the algebraic structure for solving myriad problems across the sciences. We study matrices and related topics such as linear transformations and linear spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Applications include dynamical systems, ordinary and partial differential equations, and an introduction to Fourier series.
