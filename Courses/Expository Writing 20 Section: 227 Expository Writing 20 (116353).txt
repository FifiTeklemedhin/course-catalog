understanding social norms, norms that get articulated through the witch's very violation of them. In this seminar, we ask what discourses about witches tell us about the societies that produce them. We begin by examining anthropologists' depictions of witchcraft among people who come to find magic believable: how do we understand the seemingly irrational idea that magic is real? Closely considering evidence from classic ethnographic accounts, we critically examine other scholars' answers to questions such as this one by thinking across competing approaches to the study of magic. Next, we analyze the film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the television sitcom Bewitched, bringing these pop-cultural phenomena into conversation with Mary Douglas's treatise on Purity and Danger and Pierre Bourdieu's critique of Masculine Domination. These theories help us examine, for example, how fictional representations of witches speak to political struggles over class and gender. For the research paper, each student chooses an example of witchcraft on which to conduct independent research. Sample topics include fairy tales, the Salem witch trials, neo- paganism, and the Broadway musical Wicked. What will unite our diverse inquiries is a common interest in the social significance of this seemingly marginal figure: the witch.

Class and Culture
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
It is commonplace to note that in the United States a large portion of the population self-identifies as "middle class" even though our society is marked by deep, persistent, and increasing class inequality. This incongruity between identity and social structure betrays the complex and often contradictory ways in which we experience social class in our everyday lives. This course explores the subjective experience of social class in the U.S. from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We will consider questions such as the following. What is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideals of individual achievement and meritocracy? How do educational institutions such as high schools and colleges underwrite class mobility for some and reproduce disadvantage for others? What kinds of class cultures are cultivated in elite colleges such as Harvard? The first unit considers the identities of working class people before and after the Great Recession, examining how blue color workers imagine their place in an increasingly unequal world. In the second unit we will focus on how attending an elite public university shapes the class trajectories of working class and upper middle class female students. For the third unit students will develop their own original research project concerning the role played by class divisions on elite college campuses. The course readings are drawn mainly from the social sciences, especially anthropology and sociology.

The Femme Fatale

The femme fatale--the attractive, seductive woman who brings about the downfall of any man she encountersâ€”has fascinated us through the ages, from Biblical figures like Eve, Delilah, and Salome and Ancient Egypt's
