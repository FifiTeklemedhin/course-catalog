Without borders, can there be poetry? A white paper border surrounds printed poems; digital poems are bounded by the screen on which they are read; national boundaries keep cultural and linguistic traditions distinct; and aesthetic conventions create genres and demarcate poetry from music or dance or film. How Russian poetry perversely challenges such limits, and how it thrives at the edges of the permissible, will be the subject of this course.
We will study the cultural practice of poetry as it crosses four kinds of borders â€“performative, linguistic, geographic, and aesthetic. That yields four large topics: poetry in public places (how does poetry speak of politics, and how does it write collective trauma?); poetry and translation (how does translation change poetic practice? how to read mixed-language poems?); poetry and emigration/ exile (what happens to identities and allegiances when poets cross geographical borders? What happens to the poet's language?); and poetry and the other arts (how have music, film, drama, paintings, photography, and the philosophical essay been felt in poetry? can poems become visual artifacts, or scripts for performance?).
Examples from the work of Aygi, Brodsky, Dragomoshchenko, Glazova, Kaminsky, Khlebnikov, Mandelstam, Mnatsakanova, Nabokov, Pushkin, Sedakova, Slutsky, Vvedensky. Comparisons to American poets, including Susan Howe and Anne Carson, and to films by Tarkovsky and others.
