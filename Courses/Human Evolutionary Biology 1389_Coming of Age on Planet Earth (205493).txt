         Why do adolescent sea otter take so many dangerous risks? Why do some socially stressed young adult pigs stop eating? Why do some birds wait a season or two before having sex? This course offers a species-spanning exploration of the maturational journey from adolescence to adulthood emphasizing the common challenges of this period. The course will explore how young adult animals learn to be safe, how they acquire or lose status and rank, and how they come of age sexually. Throughout the class the exploration of animal maturation will be applied and compared to the human journey from adolescence to adulthood. Interested students can bring 'coming-of-age' literature will into their coursework, identifying the common challenges of this period in the animal kingdom and human life.
