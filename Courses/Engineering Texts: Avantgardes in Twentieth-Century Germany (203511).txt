         This seminar explores the intersections among art, science, and industry as they were thematized by innovative strands of twentieth-century German culture. Topics will include the fascination of artists with the machine and the artificial human being at the dawn of the twentieth-century; the literary responses to the mechanized warfare of the First World War; the modern metropolis; media and politics in interwar Berlin; the architectural projects of the Third Reich; and the literature and culture of the divided Germany. The seminar will conclude by examining new possibilities afforded to German-speaking cultures with the arrival of cybernetics and the internet. Our readings and viewings will include Benjamin, Brecht, Kittler, Lang, Riefenstahl, Vostell, and others.
