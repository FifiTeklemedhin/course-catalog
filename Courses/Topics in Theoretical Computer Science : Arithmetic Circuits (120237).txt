Topics in Theoretical Computer Science : Arithmetic Circuits (120237)
Mrinal Kumar
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: F 1000 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the area of Arithmetic Circuit Complexity and to try and get a sense of the power and limitations of arithmetic circuits as a computational model. We hope to see a combination of both classical and recent results in this area, including some upper bounds, lower bounds and questions about factoring and derandomization.
