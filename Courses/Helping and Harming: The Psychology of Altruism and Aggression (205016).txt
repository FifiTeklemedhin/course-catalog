Jill Hooley
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 16
How do people help and harm each other? Who helps or harms whom, and why? How do upbringing and early experience foster altruism and aggression? Which emotions, thoughts, and situations promote helping and harming? How important are biological (genetic, hormonal, brain) factors? What canwe learn about humans from the behavior of chimpanzees and other species? Using concepts and research from social, developmental, and evolutionary psychology, we will explore specific ways people help and harm each other to work toward understanding and influencing altruistic and aggressive behavior.
