the twentieth century, some critics even argued that art is only effective when it jolts us out of our customary ways of relating to the world, or when it makes explicit the structures of violence and oppression that operate invisibly. This course will begin by exploring works of art and literature by Michelangelo, Edouard Manet, and Charles Baudelaire that were considered transgressive in their time but which have since been incorporated into the canon of art history. Is an artwork deemed shocking because of its own intrinsic qualities, or because of the norms and values of its viewing culture? How did these creations and their controversies shape or redirect the course of art history? In our second unit, we will study some contemporary artists who understand "shock" to be an integral part of their aesthetic projects. In looking at Damien Hirst's pickled animal installations, or Tracey Emin's own stained mattress set in the middle of the Tate Gallery, or Kara Walker's provocative 75-foot-long sphinx made out of sugar, why do these artists want their audience to feel such alarm and unease? We will consider these artworks alongside readings by feminist critics, philosophers, and art theorists who defend art even at its most outrageous extremes. Can shock motivate moral or ethical reasoning? Is shock a particularly political feeling? And why are images or representations of the body so central to this genre of art? The third unit will investigate how institutions –like museums, the media, and even universities like Harvard –play a role in either canonizing transgressive art or else fanning the flames of public outrage. Students will have the opportunity to visit the Harvard Art Museum as they work on their final, individual research papers.

demeaning. For a woman to be "ladylike," after all, often means she is relegated to a corner where she will not be assertive and empowered. But for centuries, women fought and died to be allowed that reputation. Being a "respectable" woman meant being fully human –and fully protected—and then over time that identity became a shackle to break free of. This course will examine the curious history of "respectable" womanhood to see what happened to those women who battled to be valued, sometimes for the most fundamental human status, and sometimes for the right to cross the bounds of propriety. What were the real risks of walking the line of respectable and unladylike and the dangers of stepping outside the lines? While modern feminism fights against restrictive stereotypes, why did some women fight to keep them? This course consists of three units, each focusing on a different moment in American history. We will begin with women who lost their lives when their neighbors began to question whether they really were "women" at all –the Salem witches. Using close reading skills we will sift through historical documents to understand just how the people of Salem were willing to decide some of their own daughters were not really human after all. Next we will move forward two centuries to read the fascinating memoir of anti-lynching crusader Ida B Wells, a woman who once travelled for two days to protect her reputation against slander. We will learn about race and womanhood in the late 19th century to understand why in order to be a reformer, Wells had to be a lady first. Finally, we will take on a research project on iconic 20th-century figures from Civil Rights lawyer Pauli Murray to Hillary Clinton, women who found themselves caught between being ladies and being leaders. Throughout we will examine how racial and sexual stereotypes posed not only challenges but also unexpected opportunities for rebels and reformers. What power does being a lady hold, and what boundaries does it create? What does it mean, both yesterday and today, to be not just female, but a woman?
