This seminar investigates various forms of art making in order to answer one central question: how to process the experiences of daily life by expressing them in a work of art. The creative parts of the course will take place inside the sculpture studio of VES, but collecting the materials to use will happen outside it, as we gather "found objects" at places like the Harvard Recycling Center, which will in turn offer us new perspectives on the use of materials in our everyday life at Harvard and beyond. On a field trip to New York City we will visit different locations where an artwork and its urban environment have influenced one another. The seminar includes a broad introduction to various methodologies of artistic creation, not only tangible but also intangible (e.g., sound recordings). Weekly practical and reading assignments are required. By end of the semester, we will present our works in an informal exhibition/intervention/happening.
Course Notes: There will be a required trip to New York City. All trip expenses will be covered by the program.
Requirements: Course open to Freshman Students Only Additional Course Attributes:
