Science is not just a history of ideas, and it is not just made by scientists. It is also made by technicians, assistants and others, and it is a product of craft traditions, tools and instruments, cultures of laboratory life, concerns about openness and secrecy, concerns about intellectual property, and more. Spanning some 400 years, this course will thus explore how science is actually "made," using case studies from the fields of astronomy, physics, microbiology, technology, and engineering. We will be interested, not only in the nitty-gritty practices and "stuff" of science, but also in all the people, visible and less visible, who are variously involved in making it. Particular attention will be paid to the ways in which different roles in the making of science are influenced by social status, race and gender.
