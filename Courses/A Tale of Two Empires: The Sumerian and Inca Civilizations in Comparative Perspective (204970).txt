A Tale of Two Empires: The Sumerian and Inca Civilizations in Comparative Perspective (204970)
Gary Urton Piotr Steinkeller
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course takes a comparative perspective on the study of two of the great civilizations of the ancient world â€“the Sumerians, in ancient Iraq, and the Incas, in the central Andes of South America. While Sumerian civilization stood near the beginning of a long line of descendant states and empires in the ancient Near East, the Incas were at the end of a long line of evolution of a number of earlier states and empires. One question we will examine is what effect this difference in the position of our two societies with respect to earlier or later societies has on our view of the accomplishments of each civilization. We will examine what was similar and what was different about these two ancient societies in their respective settings; what we can learn about the nature and organization of ancient empires from a comparative study of these two societies; and what a study of these two societies can teach us about the meaning of "civilization" from comparative, cross-cultural perspectives.
