2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Modeling and analysis of mechanical and electromechanical systems. Topics include 3D rigid body dynamics, resonance, damping, frequency response, Laplace transform methods, Lagrange's equations, multiple degree-of- freedom systems and an introduction to nonlinear vibration, continuous systems, and control. Analytical modeling will be supplemented with numerical simulations and lab experiments. Laboratory exercises will explore vibration, stabilization, and nonlinear systems using data acquisition systems.
