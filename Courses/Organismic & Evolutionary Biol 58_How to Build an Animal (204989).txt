           Ever wonder why you and other animals have eyes? What about teeth or even skin? "How to Build an Animal" answers your questions by exploring the wonders of animal biology. Each week, we consider a prominent feature of animal anatomy; study its variation in form and function; and how it's made during embryonic development. To facilitate student learning, each topic is accompanied by a 'hands-on' activity that illustrates the concepts discussed in the lecture. Further, the course introduces a number of scientific areas, including comparative anatomy, functional morphology, phylogenetics, genomics, and experimental embryology. The overall goal is to provide a basic understanding of animal evolution and development and how these processes combine to shape the diversity of life on Earth.
