Mexico: Revolution, Authoritarianism and Democracy: 100 Years (156163)
Jorge DomiÃÅnguez
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Mexico, a U.S. neighbor, over the past century experienced a prolonged violent revolutionary war and subsequent transformation, established one of the world's longest-lived authoritarian regimes, and has been building a robust democratic political system. The combination of these three dramatic moments is rare worldwide. Most countries in the past century have had only one or two such moments, not all three. Why did Mexicans kill each other so relentlessly for so long? Why did they build, from the rulers' perspective, perhaps the world's most effective authoritarian regime? Why was democratic transition so slow-moving and what forms has it taken? What has been the role of statesmen and scoundrels, business executives and indigenous movements, political parties and the experience of existing on the U.S. border? Examine why Mexico had no Lenin, no Adenauer, and no Mandela. Ponder why some Bishops in the 1920s ordered priests to refuse the sacraments, and why such an ethnically heterogeneous country lacks ethnic-based political parties. The seminar will also examine the deliberate collective wisdom of democratic politics, steering a successful transition since the late 1990s.
