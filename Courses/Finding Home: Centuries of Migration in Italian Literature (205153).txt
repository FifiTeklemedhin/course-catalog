           Italy hosts more than 5 million foreign residents who are now a part of the Italian cultural landscape, at times welcoming and at other times reluctant, even hostile. Through the works of Italians abroad and newcomers to the Italian peninsula, this course offers a multimedia exploration of how longstanding literary tradition both invites and rejects change and newness. Novels, films and cultural artifacts in the form of magazine publications and photographs will provide the context for a discussion about what the future holds for Italy and Italian-ness. Authors will include Ennio Flaiano, Amara Lakhous, and others. All texts will be provided in Italian and English, and the course will be conducted in English with weekly discussions in Italian for those interested.
