This course asks who Boccaccio and Petrarch were to each other and to the process of Italian literature's becoming. They are famous for their prose and poetry in the vernacular, but they also wrote each other many letters of praise, admonishment and showmanship. We will enjoy reliving their correspondence as well as studying the innovations they introduced in their most famous works. Primary texts will include Boccaccio's Decameron and Petrarch's Canzoniere.
