What defines the Middle East? What long-term historical and cultural developments can we trace in the region? How do these affect contemporary global order and policy? This team-taught course in the NELCdepartment will address these three fundamental questions of great present relevance by introducing students to the ancient and modern peoples, languages, cultures, and societies of Western Asia and North Africa. The study of this diverse region is uniquely aided by a deep-time perspective afforded by thousands of years of vibrant art, writing and cultural artefacts. Relying on the classic expertise integral to area studies, the course brings together faculty from a variety of disciplines –from history and archaeology to literature and philology, and from sociology and economy to the political sciences –in a common endeavour to explore the rich cultural complex of the region through four key topics: history, religion, literature and politics.
Course Notes: Formerly NEC 97r, this course satisfies the NELC Sophomore Tutorial requirements. Taught by Members of the Department.
