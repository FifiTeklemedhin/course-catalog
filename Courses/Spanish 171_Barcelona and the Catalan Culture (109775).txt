2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The course offers an interdisciplinary approach to Barcelona, a multilayered space furnished by Roman, French, Muslim, and Spanish legacies that shaped a singular culture and language. Developing from periods of egalitarian social and political institutions in the Middle Ages to strong socioeconomic industrial development in the 19th century and later tourism, Spain's most European city is inscribed by a deep sense of civic and industrious society permanently seeking innovation and modernity, yet facing the consequences of its complex past. Through readings of historians, art critics, urban designers, and writers, and supported by visual materials, the course offers an integrated perspective which opens questions in every field of the Humanities and the Social Sciences on Catalan and Hispanic Cultures.
Course Notes: The course will be conducted in Spanish. The readings will be in English & Spanish.
