This course provides a comprehensive overview of human pathology with emphasis on mechanisms of disease and modern diagnostic technologies. Topics include (1) general mechanisms of disease (inflammation, infection, immune injury, host response to foreign materials, transplantation, genetic disorders and neoplasia), (2) pathology of major organ systems, and (3) review of diagnostic tools from invasive surgical pathology to non-invasive techniques such as diagnostic imaging and molecular pathology. The objectives of this course are achieved through a set of integrated lectures and laboratories, as well as a student-driven term project leading to a formal presentation on a medical, socioeconomic, or technological issue in human pathology.
