The impact of the brain's circadian clock on sleep becomes evident when we travel across time zones or shift our sleep on weekends. How does this clock work? How does light from a tablet or smartphone affect our biology? What is the best time for sleep? What about naps? This course will explore the neurobiology of the brain's circadian clock that regulates the timing and structure of sleep, its interaction with the periodic environment, and the consequences of circadian disruption in our 24/7 society on health, performance and safety.
