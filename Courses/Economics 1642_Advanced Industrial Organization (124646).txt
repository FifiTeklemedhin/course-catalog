          This course studies firms, markets and competition. We will study the theory of industrial organization, focusing on analyzing the way firms make decisions, as well as the impact of those decisions on market outcomes such as market prices, quantities, the type of products offered and social welfare. The fundamental questions addressed in this course include: Why are markets organized the way they are? How does market organization affect firm behavior, such as firm production or pricing? How does the behavior of firms in turn affect the market structure, such as the number of firms or the range of products offered? We will use formal models in order to address these questions. The goals of the course include the development of intuition for firm strategic behavior, such as pricing, as well as the development of skills for the analysis of formal models. The textbook will provide background and introduction to a variety of topics, many of which will be covered in class in greater depth. Lectures (along with problem sets) will be the core of the course.
Course Notes: Ec 1640 and Ec 1642 may not both be taken for credit.
