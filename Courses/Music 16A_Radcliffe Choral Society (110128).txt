             Radcliffe Choral Society (SSAA choir). The Radcliffe Choral Society is dedicated to the celebration and performance of women's choral music. Founded in 1899, RCS is Harvard's oldest women's organization and one of the country's premier women's choruses. The Choral Society sings a wide variety of repertoire including Medieval chant, Renaissance polyphony, Romantic masterworks, international folk songs, and contemporary women's choral music. RCS tours annually. The Choral Society frequently combines with the Collegium and the Glee Club, as well as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, to perform large-scale works. Students must complete both parts of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.
