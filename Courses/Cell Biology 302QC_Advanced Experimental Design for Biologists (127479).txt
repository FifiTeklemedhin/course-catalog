         This course will focus on both the theory and practice of experimental design. The emphasis is on project planning and vetting, individual experimental design, and trouble-shooting. Special focus will be placed on methods to avoid experimental bias, and potential sources of inappropriate interpretation. Also the importance of system validation is especially emphasized.
