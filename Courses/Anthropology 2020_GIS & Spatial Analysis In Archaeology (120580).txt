An introduction to the GIS and remote sensing methods used by archaeologists to document and analyze datasets at the regional scale. This class will involve the hands-on use of maps, aerial photography, satellite imagery, digital terrain models and GPS-based observations to frame and approach archaeological research questions. Labs will use sample datasets from a variety of regions but students will be responsible for assembling a GIS database for their own region of interest.
