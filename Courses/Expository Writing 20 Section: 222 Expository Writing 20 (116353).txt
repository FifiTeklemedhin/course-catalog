tested the boundary between private life and public art. In the second unit, we will turn from photography-as-art to the rise of photojournalism, and in particular, to a ground-breaking series of photo-essays from Life magazine on racial segregation in the South. In our final unit, we will grapple with the problem of proof and deception in the digital age by exploring the critical response to the JPEG files shared among soldiers inside the Abu Ghraib prison at the height of the Iraq war.

The Psychology of Success and
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Who gets ahead in America? Why do some succeed while others fail? Given knowledge of someone's background, can we predict if she will become successful? Is it possible to change the course of an individual's trajectory? How do we account for the influence of various complex factors, including family, community, and society? In this course, we will examine questions of success, failure, achievement, and identity viewed through the lens of current theories in psychology. We will begin with The Overachievers, a best-selling journalistic account of the pressure for academic achievement felt by students at an elite public high school on the East Coast. We'll consider how passion, motivation, and competition all contribute to an individual's drive to succeed. Next, we will read Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The story of success and apply it as a lens to analyze a longitudinal, ethnographic study of 12 American children. We will explore how race, gender, and familial wealth and resources affected these children's lived experiences of childhood and, later, their chances of successfully getting into college. In the final unit of the course, we will use a popular psychology book on habits as a jumping off point to complete independent research papers that examine how factors like self-control, willpower, mindfulness, and creativity contribute to success. Throughout the course, we will use psychological theory to motivate questions and answers about human

Faking It to Make It
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Between 2002 and 2005, serial impostor Esther Reed took classes in the Harvard Extension School and participated in the university's debate team under the name Natalie Bowman. She later posed as an honors student at Columbia University. A similar deception took place at Princeton in the early 1990s when Alexi Indris-Santana, track team and Ivy Club member, was revealed to be a 31-year-old impostor named James Hogue. Reed's and Hogue's ability to pass as students at prestigious universities raises questions about the relationship between lying, success, and cultural standards. How do lies inform the ways we think about ourselves? What is the appeal of living one's life as a masquerade or performance? In a world where technology increasingly blurs the lines between life and fiction, is deception ever justified? This course examines the ways deception impacts our lives and shapes our sense of self at a time when notions of what is real and what is fake are increasingly being called into question. We begin by analyzing the role of rumors and storytelling in The Great Gatsby, where F. Scott Fitzgerald reshapes our understanding of the confidence man by turning him into a cultural icon. Then, we examine the ethics and morality of deception by testing Friedrich Nietzsche's and Sigmund Freud's notions of truth against films such as Chicago, Quiz Show, and The Prestige. In our final unit, students will have the opportunity to research an instance of imposture in contemporary culture or fiction and make an argument that interprets and assesses its significance. Sample topics include hoaxes such as Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds broadcast, the creation of fake online identities for "catfishing" the unsuspecting, and race, class, and gender passing.
