This interdisciplinary course introduces students to the history of one of the foundational historical moments of American, Atlantic, and World history: the transatlantic slave trade and the Middle Passage. Exploring representation of the Middle Passage in literature, history, film, legal depositions, economic texts, the course aims to expand our understanding of the complex experience of the Middle Passage and to highlight its role in the creation of America.The course will examine the different narrative and rhetorical strategies adopted to tell this story and will ask questions such as: What happens when we tell transatlantic history from different vantage points and in different forms and genres? How do Black authors and scholars engage with this history? In what ways does the history of the transatlantic slave trade shape the understanding and construction of race and "Americanness"?
