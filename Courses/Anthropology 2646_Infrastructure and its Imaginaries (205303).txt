Infrastructures are the sociotechnical unconscious of modern societies. Bridges, cables, and pipes, but also assemblages of affect, information, and valueâ€”infrastructures underpin everyday living by coordinating the flow of
people, things, and knowledge. Infrastructures often remain unremarked, and only when they break down do we become aware of them. Recently, however, infrastructures have surfaced as a key problem in public life. In response, a growing body of scholarship has sought to rethink infrastructure, its politics and poetics. Drawing on classic and contemporary readings, this course takes up the anthropology of infrastructure. What is infrastructure? What new questions and concerns are raised by exploring sociocultural worlds through the optic of infrastructure? What concepts and methods are helpful for researching and writing about infrastructure? The first part of the course tackles these conceptual and methodological questions; the second part turns to recent ethnographies of infrastructure, exploring infrastructural politics; the third part looks at infrastructures in terms of the imaginaries they help stabilize and sustain.
