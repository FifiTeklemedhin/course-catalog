         What makes a novel "political," and what contribution can novels make to political theories? How do novels manage to stage political debates rather than arguing clearly for one side or the other? How does narrative form reinforce or undermine ideology? What archetypal dramas –protest against authority, the loss of political innocence, the battle between tolerance and conviction –have shaped the political novel in its various traditions from the eighteenth century to the present? Readings may include Kleist, Pushkin, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Melville, Conrad, Olbracht, Gordimer, Coetzee, Atwood, Bolaño, Le Guin, Teju Cole, and others.
