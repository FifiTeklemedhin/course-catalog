         Natural selection produces genetic changes that make a population better able to reproduce and survive in an ever- changing environment, a process known as adaptation. This course examines adaptations common to all humans (since divergence from our closest primate relatives) and those that have occurred in particular populations as humans dispersed around the globe and responded to the challenges of novel environments, diets, and diseases. We will focus on the genetic evidence for adaptations as detected from the signals left by natural selection on the genome. Evidence for potentially adaptive alleles having been introduced into some human genomes from hominin relatives, the Neandertals and Denisovans, will be considered. To place human adaptations in broader evolutionary perspective, we will investigate adaptations in diverse non-human species where the genetic and genomic bases of adaptation are often known more completely.
