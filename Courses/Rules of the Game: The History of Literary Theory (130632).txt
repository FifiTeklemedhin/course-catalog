         The practice of reading literature is informed by theoretical assumptions that sometimes are made explicit but often are not. These (frequently rival) assumptions have a long history; understanding that history means understanding what is at stake when we argue about literature. The class considers theories of literature from Plato and Aristotle to the twentieth century.
