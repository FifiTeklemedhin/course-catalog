At its core, the study of social inequality seeks to answer two simple questions: who gets what, and why? The course is organized into three units that represent core elements of social position: social class, race/ethnicity, and sex/gender. Each unit will begin with a descriptive assessment of how socioeconomic resources are distributed. We will then explore the social processes, structures, and institutions that influence the distribution of these resources. The course materials consist of a selection of books that have defined contemporary research on social inequality.
Course Notes: May be counted for introductory concentration requirement, if letter-graded. Additional Course Attributes:
