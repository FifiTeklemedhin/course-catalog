         This course grapples with key controversies –suicide bombings, blasphemy, gender, Muslim minorities, Islamism – as a point of entry into understanding Muslim cultures and societies. Drawing on insights from Cultural Anthropology and related fields (Religious Studies, History, Government, Philosophy, Law), the course also encourages self- reflection on our own assumptions regarding religion, secularism, freedom, tolerance and violence. Finally, by dwelling on the case of cross-cultural (mis)understandings related to Islam, the course underscores that no matter what our personal objectives –social theorizing, developing policy, or being an engaged global citizen –there is value in understanding how historical and cultural contexts shape us all. No prior familiarity with Islam is required or assumed.
Course Notes: Q-scores listed at http://goo.gl/yKXrHE and https://goo.gl/vidcam. Open to all concentrations/years; no prior familiarity with Islam or Anthropology is
