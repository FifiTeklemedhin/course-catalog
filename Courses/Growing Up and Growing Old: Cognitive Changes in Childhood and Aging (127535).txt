This seminar will focus on the profound cognitive changes of early childhood and old age. We will be especially interested in what such changes tell us about how the adult mind -- perched between childhood and old age -- is organized. Topics include: theories of development and theories of aging, changes in the neural substrate; the rise and fall of executive functions; conceptual gain and conceptual loss; expertise and wisdom; healthy aging and dementias.
