Between the first international financial crisis of 1720, and the French Revolution's overthrow of the monarchy and aristocratic privilege, economic realities and material concerns were at the heart of Enlightenment writers' understanding of contemporary social issues, as well as of their views on how to improve the human condition. This course will examine questions pertaining to money and the origin of value, luxury and consumption in a global context, the threats of despotism and acting with impunity, as well as the limits of commerce in slavery. What views of individual mobility and value did genres such as novels, plays, essays and treatises propose? In turn, what strategies of resistance did they offer to individuals to define themselves outside of, or against, material wealth?
