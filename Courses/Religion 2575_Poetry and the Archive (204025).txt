         Much contemporary American poetry in English, both in the United States and in Canada, roots itself in documentary and archival work, telling often fractured and multi-vocal stories about particular places, times, environments, and events. The course will explore key examples of this work alongside recent theoretical discussions of the archive. Authors to be read will likely include Jacques Derrida, Susan Howe, C. D. Wright, Brenda Coultas, S. Nourbese Philip, C. S. Giscombe, and Jill Magi.
