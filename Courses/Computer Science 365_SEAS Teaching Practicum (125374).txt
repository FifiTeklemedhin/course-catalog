Practicum emphasizing an active but reflective approach to teaching applied sciences and engineering; there is nothing in the course that is specific to Computer Science. Topics: presentation and communication; in-class teaching and interaction; developing, grading and giving feedback on assignments; course head / TF relations and expectations; cognition and learning. Seminar style with an emphasis on observation, practice, feedback, discussion, and reflection. While the primary context of the course is classroom-style teaching, those interested in developing instructional communication skills in other contexts within science and engineering -- labs/studios,

presentations, etc. -- are quite welcome, and course tasks can be adjusted for such.
