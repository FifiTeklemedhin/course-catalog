          We think all the time. But what are thoughts made up of? And what are the many different ways in which we think? Do we think in pictures or in words? When you're hungry, do you think about "food" or about "almond pancakes with Vermont maple syrup"? Do children think differently from adults? How does imagination affect our moral judgment? How do we prospect about the future? Is abstract thinking "deeper" or "better" than concrete thinking? Are pictures more "emotional" than words? And do situational factors play a role in the way we think, or is it all about stable individual differences?
The purpose of this course is to think about thoughts. We will give some answers to these and other fascinating questions about how people think, and what are the implications of the style of thought to perceptions, judgments, predictions, and actions towards the social world. Our goals are (1) to understand the cognitive processes that underlie different styles of thought, and the neural correlates of these mechanisms; (2) to compare different approaches to the concept of abstraction; (3) to consider under what circumstances people naturally use more abstract (versus more concrete) representations of information; and (4) to examine the expression of abstraction processes in the realm of social cognition.
