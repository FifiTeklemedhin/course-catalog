Tell Old Pharaoh: Histories of "Contraband Camps" and Self-Emancipation in the Civil War Era (205431)
Mycah Conner
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
This seminar examines the Civil War and Reconstruction as experienced by the people who fled from slavery during the war, whom Gen. Benjamin Butler labeled "contraband of war." It interprets "contraband camps" as stages of confrontation and battlefields in their own right, which illuminate consequential struggles for and against slavery and freedom. It investigates the connections between the experiences within camps and experiences beyond them (on plantations, battlefields, halls of governance, and elsewhere), transformations underway in the eastern and western theaters, and what the ordeal reveals about the next worlds made by the freedpeopleâ€”women and men, old and young.
