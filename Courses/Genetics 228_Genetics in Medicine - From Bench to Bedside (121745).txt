2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: F 0200 PM - 0459 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: n/a
Focus on translational medicine: the application of basic genetic discoveries to human disease. Each three-hour class will focus on a specific genetic disorder and the approaches currently used to speed the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to the clinic. Each class will include a clinical discussion, a patient presentation if appropriate, followed by lectures, a detailed discussion of recent laboratory findings and a student led journal club. Lecturers will highlight current molecular, technological, bioinformatic and statistical approaches that are being used to advance the study of human disease. There is no exam. Students will present one paper per session in a journal club style. Attendance and active participation for the duration of all class meetings is required. If you are unable to attend class, or cannot be present for the entire session you are expected to contact the course instructor. Two incomplete or missed sessions will result in a failing grade.
