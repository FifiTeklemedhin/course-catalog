People around the world observe the same basic celestial phenomena- the rise and set of stars, the changing phases of the moon, the occasional bewildering eclipse. But cultures have come to interpret these signs very differently, giving rise to diverse calendar systems and mythological frameworks. For instance, the position of the sun, the visibility of star formations, and the lunar cycle have all been used to define the concept of the year, sometimes with more than one definition operating in a single culture. We will perform a survey of traditional astronomical systems, highlighting the original aspects of each and trying to understand the origin of differences. Why were some observations considered more significant than others (Which is more important, the shape of the moon or the identity of stars around it?)? How did mundane pressures, such as the need to sow and reap, influence how cultures tracked celestial motion? We will end with a more detailed exploration of the early Western and Arab astronomy. What specific advancements and conditions allowed them ultimately to "get it right?"
Course Notes: A five-hour field trip to observe the sky away from city lights is required. No previous knowledge of astronomy or celestial mechanics is required.
