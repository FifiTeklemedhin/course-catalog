         This course examines the technologies used in the production of ceramic vessels, bricks, tiles, and mortars in ancient and non-industrial societies. It also focuses on the laboratory-analytical techniques that enable reconstruction of these technologies.
The course has been designed to consider: (1) the principles of geology and of materials science and engineering HARVARD UNIVERSITY 9/4/2017 0:39 AM
that provide an understanding of the properties and behavior of clays (and other ceramic materials) as materials systems; (2) the activities involved in producing, using, and distributing ceramic materials and ceramic products; (3) the culture-producing and culture-using aspects of ceramic technologies.
Laboratory sessions include microscopy with emphasis on petrography of ceramics and geological materials, mechanical testing of fired ceramics, and the appropriate methods for documenting and reporting the analyses of archaeological artifacts made from ceramic materials.
