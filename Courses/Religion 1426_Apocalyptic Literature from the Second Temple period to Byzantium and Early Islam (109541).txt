The course will review a broad sample of texts belonging to the apocalyptic genre and composed between the third century BCE and the seventh century CE. The main goal of the course is to reflect on the crucial role played by apocalyptic literature in shaping religious thoughts and practices as well as socio-political movements and ethical choices in a span of time that witnessed the formation of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions as we know them today. Moreover, the course will introduce students to interpretive tools useful to think about the relationship between ancient apocalyptic literature and the contemporary world in selected areas such as historical imaginations of the future, violence and religion, and means to reflect on change.
