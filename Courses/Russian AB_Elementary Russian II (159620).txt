           Part two of a two part introductory course in modern Russian language and culture, designed for students without previous knowledge of Russian who would like to speak Russian or use the language for reading and research. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Students are introduced to Russian culture and the etiquette of social exchanges, and expand their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary through readings (including stories, biography, and poetry), videos, and class discussions.
Course Notes:
Part two of a two-part series. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in Russian AA in the fall and Russian AB in the spring within the same academic year.
This course will also meet for two additional hours of speaking practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Meeting times for the T-Th practice sections are subject to adjustment based on students' availability. See language course notes on the Slavic Department website for information about sectioning, pass/fail, satisfactory/unsatisfactory, and auditing: https://slavic.fas.harvard.edu/language-course-notes
