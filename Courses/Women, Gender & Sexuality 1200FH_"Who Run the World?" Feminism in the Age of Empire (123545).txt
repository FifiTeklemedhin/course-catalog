This course explores the intimate relationship between colonialism, racism, and feminism from the eighteenth century until today. We will study the emergence of feminism across British imperial spaces, including America and Britain, India, and Sub-saharan Africa. The central problematic of the course is the concept of liberation. We will critically engage how the idea of "liberation" organizes global feminist thought: liberation from what, by whom, and to what end? Readings and assignments focus on primary historical sources that explore colonial power, racial difference, religious emancipation, and social and sexual revolution.
