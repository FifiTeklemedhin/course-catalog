         We live in a world of intense exchange across borders and seas, yet most history is still taught from a national or regional perspective. By studying inter-regional developments of societies around the Atlantic Ocean, we will examine how the histories of Europe, North America, Latin America and Africa are intertwined. What methods have historians used to study the trade, migration, inter-imperial competition and revolutionary upheaval that together have helped create an "Atlantic World"? Topics include trade in commodities and slaves, the Atlantic and Haitian Revolutions, and the ecological impact of exchange, among other themes.
