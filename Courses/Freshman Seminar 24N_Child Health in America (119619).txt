         How can American health care be improved for children? How a nation cares for its children's health is often considered a measure of its commitment to the general citizenry and to its future. The members of the seminar will review together the history of children's health and health care in the United States, exploring the impact of geography, environment, nutrition, clean water, as well as of the scientific discoveries of the late 19th century and the early 20th century and the emergence of the high technology care of the middle and late 20th century. Then they will pose the question, "Does America provide children and youth the best possible health care available in the 21st century?" To approach this question, students will analyze the current causes of illness, disability and death among U.S. children and youth and compare United States epidemiology with that of other developed and developing nations. Students will also explore how child health delivery is financed.
