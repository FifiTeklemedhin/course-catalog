The human mind has a remarkable capacity for story-telling and meaning-making. We weave together narratives of our lives and the world around us, we readily justify our attitudes and behavior, and we tend to perceive the world in a manner that's consistent with our narratives and justifications, even when we're confronted with evidence to the contrary. This course explores why the human mind is so prone to building stories and rationales, and the consequences of these processes both for our everyday lives and for society at large.
