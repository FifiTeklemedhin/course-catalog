          Gaga—the movement language created by Ohad Naharin, artistic director and choreographer of Batsheva Dance Company in Tel Aviv—is a continuous, sensation-based movement class. Students are encouraged to interpret and
experience the somatic practice of listening to the body while activating a total sensorial attention. Gaga offers a creative framework for students to engage with physicality and imagination, bridging the activity between body and mind while increasing physical potential. There are no mirrors in Gaga, and there are no observers. The class moves in continuum without breaks for a minimum of an hour. GAGA People is intended for and welcomes students who have not had any previous dance training
