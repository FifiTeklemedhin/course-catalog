Future—phantasm—desire—mirror-image—Other—Self: for modern Japan, America represents all of these and more. America looms as a central presence in Japan's cultural and political landscape throughout the "long twentieth century" of Japan's modern era, and there is no other country on earth that has incorporated "America" into its own self-identity so willingly and to such a degree.This class will explore what "America" has meant to Japan in concrete terms. Beginning with the arrival of the American navy's "black ships" in the 1850s, we will then turn to consider, among other topics, Protestantism and Americanism in the late nineteenth century; urban modernism and American culture in the early twentieth century; Japanese reactions to the American air raids on Japan during World

War II; the American Occupation and its influence on postwar popular culture; and the connections between Americanism and nationalism in postwar consumer society. Key players will range from Commodore Perry, General MacArthur, and Emperor Hirohito to Godzilla, Mickey Mouse, and Astro Boy, and the stage of our story will shift from Ginza, Roppongi, and Harajuku in downtown Tokyo to Tokyo Disneyland, Fukushima, and Okinawa.This course assumes no previous knowledge of Japanese history or culture, and is designed as an introduction to modern Japanese history through the unique lens of American points of contact. At the same time, the course's central focus on Japanese popular audio-visual culture, such as film, advertisement, and television, will enable students to think critically about representation and cultural objects from a variety of historical and theoretical perspectives.
Class Notes: This course will be taught by Visiting Professor Shun'ya Yoshimi from the University of Tokyo.
