Jonathan Bolton
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 14
From Socrates and Antigone to Pussy Riot and Ai Weiwei, we are fascinated by the courage of dissidents who oppose tyrannical regimes. But who are dissidents, and where do they gain the conviction, imagination, and political skill to stand up for their beliefs? In this course, we will investigate the role of non-violent dissent in political and cultural life, looking at both historical figures and political actors in the world today. After considering some classic statements of dissent (including Socrates' Apology, Sophocles' Antigone, and Martin Luther King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail"), we will turn to recent and contemporary dissidents to think about their paths into
protest, their strategies of political and cultural protest, their complicated relationship with their fellow citizens, and their portrayal in domestic and international media.
Our focus will be on individuals rather than on social movements, and on non-violent rather than violent or revolutionary protest. Drawing examples from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe during the Cold
War, contemporary Russia, China, and other countries, we will consider figures such as Václav Havel, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Vladimir Bukovsky, Liu Xiaobo, Ai Weiwei, Pussy Riot, and others.
