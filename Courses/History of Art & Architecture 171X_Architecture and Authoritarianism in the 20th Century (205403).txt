         In this proseminar, we will explore the topic of authority in architecture by analyzing authoritarian regimes and their architectural production in Europe, Africa and the Americas, as well as the material and intellectual connections between these geographies. By examining the techniques, sources and strategies through which architecture has established its authority, we will uncover the ways these have intersected the sphere of politics, government and national sovereignty in the 20th Century. A particular focus will be placed on the contexts where dictatorships have toppled democratic forms of government. Our aim is to go beyond the notion of an architecture in the service of the state, and to engage the diverse fields of power that come together in architecture.
