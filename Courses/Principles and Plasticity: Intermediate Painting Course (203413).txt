This studio course explores abstraction through the principles of two-dimensional design, from the Gestalt theories of perception to the teachings of Hans Hofmann and additional artists working within this tradition. Employing discussion, text, film, music and in-class lab assignments, we will attempt a 360-degree examination of the visual and philosophical foundations of expressionist mark making. The in-class lab emphasizes the role of composition, form and color in abstraction.
