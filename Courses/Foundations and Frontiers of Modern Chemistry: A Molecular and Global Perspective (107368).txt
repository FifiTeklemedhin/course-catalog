Foundations and Frontiers of Modern Chemistry: A Molecular and Global Perspective (107368)
James Anderson Gregory C. Tucci
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The Physical Sciences hold the key to solving unprecedented problems at the intersection of science, technology, and an array of rapidly emerging global scale challenges. The course emphasizes a molecular scale understanding of energy and entropy; free energy in equilibria, acid/base reactivity, and electrochemistry; molecular bonding and kinetics; catalysis in organic and inorganic systems; the union of quantum mechanics, nanostructures, and photovoltaics; and the analysis of nuclear energy. Case studies are used both to develop quantitative reasoning and to directly link these principles to global strategies.
Course Notes:
A few operations of calculus are developed and used. Fluency in pre- calculus secondary school mathematics is assumed. Students are expected to have high school chemistry, or have completed school mathematics. Students are expected to have high school chemistry, or have completed Life and Physical Sciences A (LPS A) or Life Sciences 1a (LS 1a), or have received permission of the instructors.
Physical Sciences 10 and Physical Sciences 11 may be taken in any order. The general chemistry requirement for medical students can be satisfied
