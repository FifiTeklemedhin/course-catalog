         The body is a site for producing difference, desire, and history: it is a foundational archive for feminist theory. This course examines key theoretical texts in feminist and queer theory through the concept of the body. We will study how bodies, sexualities, and desires have come to be archived, and how ideas of the body have shaped feminist and queer theories, trans studies, and dis/ability studies. Through the concept of the body, we will explore theories that link gender and sexuality to racial, religious, and class difference.
