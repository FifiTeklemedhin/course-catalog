Comedy has often been thought of as the poor relation to Drama but, as Lenny Bruce said, "the only honest art form is comedy because you can't fake it." We will attempt to take comedy seriously by studying its component parts and engaging in committed, creative and collaborative "play" that will tap into each student's personal, individual sense of humor. The class will focus on the basics of improvisation: group games, narrative skills, patterns, offers, spontaneity, agreement, using the space around you, building on-stage relationships and, eventually, scene work.
