2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1000 AM - 1129 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Poland was one of the largest countries in Europe and a multi-ethnic commonwealth; just two centuries later, it had been erased from the map, occupied by three different empires and subjected to constant struggles for independence. Today, it is a medium-size monolithic nation state in the middle of Europe, closely watched for its political developments.
Our course will survey key topics in Poland's 1000-year history by examining important works of literature, art, architecture, and film. We will consider how the past, both celebrated and contested, can shape a country's contemporary politics and cultural landscape. We'll also examine the interplay between local, national, and international geographies as we track Poland's ever-changing borders; students will create a personal travel guide and symbolic map of Polish culture, considering the contributions and histories of Poles, Jews, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Belarussians, Germans and Russians in what was one of Europe's most multi-ethnic and multi- confessional spaces.
