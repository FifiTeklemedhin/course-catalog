We will trace the influence of particular philosophical arguments concerning science that have developed over the last 500 years ,with the evolution of Scientific Method in biology, showing how changes in philosophy wrought changes in methodology. The course will impart on students familiar or new to the study of philosophy a framework for thinking about philosophical arguments, as well as a foundation for exploring how today's scientific method relates to scientific research, medicine, and society's popular understanding of science. This might be of particular importance given current controversies relating to the reproducibility of many published findings.
