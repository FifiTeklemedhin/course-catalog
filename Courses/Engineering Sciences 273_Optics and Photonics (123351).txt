         The focus is on the foundations of optics/photonics and on some of its most important modern developments and applications. Powerful and widely used computational tools will be developed in the sections. Topics to be covered: Maxwell's equations, Free space optics. Reflection, refraction, polarization (Jones Calculus and Stokes parameters); interference and diffraction. Light-matter interaction, dispersion and absorption. Guided wave optics (including optical fibers). Perturbation and couple mode theory, transfer matrix methods; numerical methods. Optical resonators. Photonic crystals. Near-field optics. Metal optics and Plasmonics. Metamaterials and Metasurfaces.
Course Notes: Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.
Recommended Prep: Elements of Electromagnetism, such as taught in Applied Physics 50b, Physics 15b, Physical Sciences 12b, Engineering Sciences 151 or
