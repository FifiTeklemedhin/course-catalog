         This course will survey competing conceptions of stratification and social structure with special attention to social networks. In a minor but telling shift of emphasis, networks are cast as 'sticky': renewal of on-going contacts is strongly favored over starting afresh. The glue of social life is ever-tightening bonds of accumulating co-experience with partners. Everyday lives, including one's own, can provide multiple examples of the force of sticky networks. Stickiness binds persons into unequal circumstances that are hard to escape, that is, binds people into social strata. Overall, an overarching pattern of simple hierarchy can be shown to be inevitable. The concluding sections will present analytic and empirical grounds for an unorthodox conclusion: a unified, one-dimensional pattern governs stratification in the USA and the UK.
