         This course surveys the relationship between warfare, the military, politics, and society from the 18th century to the present. Combining methodologies from History and International Relations, we will examine the distinction between war and other kinds of inter-human conflict; the origins and effects of conscription; the relationship between modern nationalism and military service; gendered and minority perspectives on combat; and the impact of 20th- and 21st- century global wars on combatants and civilians. The course is divided into halves. The first half deals with our main themes via a broad, comparative approach that encompasses world history over the past 250 years. The second half applies general concepts to two case studies: the First World War and the Middle East War of 1948.
