         This course examines creative and critical discourses from and about the global African, Asian (Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese), and Middle Eastern (Jewish, Palestinian, Lebanese, Afghan), as well as Armenian and Latin American diasporas. We focus on the relationship among diaspora, migration, and trauma, and on the interconnections of these phenomena and constructions of artistic and cultural identities, ethnicity/race, gender/sexuality, religion, postcolonialism, transculturation (including translation), multilingualism, globalization and global history, and world literature.
