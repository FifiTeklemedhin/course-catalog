 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         Much like reading, listening is a relational, highly contingent process of meaning construction. Founded on aural sensation, it also involves processes of prediction, recognition, and imagination. It is therefore so strongly conditioned by culture that we tend to privilege certain patterns of perception at the expense of others. In this writing-intensive course we will listen to music together, refine our attention to its ingredients and its construction, share and unpack our listening strategies, develop and strengthen our vocabularies to describe what we hear, and cultivate a critical perspective on the act of listening. Since our focus is on process, our repertoire will be wide- ranging and partly selected by the class. Students will collectively edit and self-publish a monthly anthology of their writings.
