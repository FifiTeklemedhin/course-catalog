TDM production studios frame and involve participation in Theater, Dance &Media's twice yearly professionally directed and designed productions. The spring 2018 production will be directed by Paul Lazar. The preponderance of time for this course will be dedicated to the rehearsal process and performances, where the integration of theory and practice, and theater, dance, and media take place. Students will meet with the course head for seminar discussions at designated times (TBD) to examine the entire performance process through an ethnographic lens.
