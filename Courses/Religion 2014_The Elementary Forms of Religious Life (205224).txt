         In as much as the academic study of religion privileges sacred texts, and identifies religious life with liturgy or institutions like mosques, temples, churches, shrines and sacred sites, it reinforces an intellectual bias toward intransitive forms rather than transitional phenomena, and risks reducing lived experience to pre-established rubrics. The focus of this course is on modes of experience that dissolve or transgress the lines conventionally drawn between human and divine, body and mind, life and death, self and other, subject and object, human and animal, culture and nature, reality and dream. Readings for this course challenge entrenched Eurocentric distinctions between science and superstition, or modernity and premodernity, and explore the roots of religious experience in the human capacities for play, creative apperception, active imagination, and attachment.
