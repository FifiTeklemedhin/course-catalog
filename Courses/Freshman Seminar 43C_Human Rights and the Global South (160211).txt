Human rights have become a global lingua franca, invoked by leaders and movements across the political, religious and cultural spectrum. Because they can come into conflict with each other, human rights can serve to justify wars (to combat terrorists), religious intolerance (to counter fundamentalists), gender discrimination (to support religious tenets), refusal of safe haven to refugees (to promote domestic human security). Despite over half a century of international law making and domestic enactment of human rights treaties, and despite a vibrant civil society that has embraced human rights principles world-wide, remedies for violations such as torture, rape, genocide, political or economic persecution, and crippling destitution, remain elusive. This dilemma is particularly clear in situations of forced migration, when vulnerable populations are separated from individuals and institutions that traditionally provide support. This seminar will focus on the Global South and address key issues in contemporary human rights theory and practice through the lens of displaced, disenfranchised, and threatened individuals and groups. Members of the seminar will first study the philosophical and political traditions that led to codification of human rights. The seminar will then cover the legal frameworks of contemporary international human rights and humanitarian law and examine how they affect some of the most egregious human rights violations of the current

period. Case studies of pivotal controversies and decisions will be examined to explore such questions as who is a refugee or an internally displaced person (IDP), what is trafficking, when is deportation justified, what protections do civilians have in conflict settings, and what are major crimes of atrocity and war.
