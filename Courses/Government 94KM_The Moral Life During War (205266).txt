          "All's fair in love and war," or so they say. Is it true? Must we abrogate morality when faced with wartime brutality, or do we seek a moral compass, even during war? Personal accounts from WWI-II, Vietnam, Bosnia, Rwanda, and contemporary Syria suggest the stories we tell about life during war shape our ability to maintain our humanity, pointing us toward a range of moral choices, from political rebellion to moral courage and quiet resistance.
