Talmudic literature is full of stories. This is surprising, even odd, given the fact that Talmud is primarily a legal literature. What purpose do these stories serve? How, in particular, does narrative serve legal discourse? How are these narratives to be analyzed and understood, both as examples of narrative "art" and within their legal context? In addressing these questions, we will look at narrative theory in general as well as contemporary scholarship on Talmud and Talmudic narrative, with a particular focus on Mishnah and the Babylonian Talmud. Assignments will include secondary readings on and about narrative more generally, but the focus of the course-- and the majority of class-time-- will be on reading the Rabbinic texts in their original language.
