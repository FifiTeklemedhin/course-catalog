         This course will introduce the mathematics for quantum computation. This includes basic notions from quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability theory and number theory. No a priori knowledge of linear algebra is required except for a familiarity with basic facts about complex numbers and 2x2 matrices; in particular, what is taught in Mathematics 21b suffices. No a priori knowledge of either number theory or probability is needed.
