This introductory course is designed to provide a basic foundation in modern Korean language and culture by focusing on the balanced development of the interpersonal (speaking), interpretive (listening &reading), and presentational (formal speech &writing) skills. Students in Korean Ba begin by learning the complete Korean writing system (Hangul), which is followed by lessons focusing on basic conversational skills, cultural competence, and grammatical structures. To provide sufficient opportunities to apply what has been learned in class, there are small group drill sessions, language tables, and a number of other cultural activities.
