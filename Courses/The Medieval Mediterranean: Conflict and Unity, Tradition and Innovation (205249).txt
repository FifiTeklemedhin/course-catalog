This undergraduate seminar treats the medieval Mediterranean as a matrix of civilizational confluence, conflict, and transformation. Emphasis will be given to four main themes that highlight the dynamism of the region in this period and its significance for the shift from late Antiquity towards the formation of the modern world: 1) Byzantine and Islamicate societies as contested contributors to a collective Western past 2) The role of the Crusades in the construction of a civilizational "other" between motives religious and political 3) The practice of philosophy in Mediterranean societies as indicative of cultural exchange and mediation between tradition and innovation 4) The medieval Mediterranean economy and its relationship to emergent political configurations, the Atlantic slave trade,
