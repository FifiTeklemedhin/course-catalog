This quarter course will offer students an in-depth examination of current knowledge regarding mechanisms of cell fate decisions. It will examine these processes in the context of developmental cell plasticity, cellular reprogramming, and cancer. This will primarily be a literature-based course with examination and discussion of key studies in the field. Concepts involving the instructive role of lineage-specific transcription factors, transcription factor cross-antagonism, feedback loops, gene regulatory networks, multilineage priming, pioneer factors, epigenetics, chromatin remodeling factors, "super enhancers", stem cell bias, lineage identity maintenance, mitotic bookmarking, non-coding RNAs, cell polarity, asymmetric cell division, Notch signaling, lateral inhibition, lineage plasticity, and cellular reprogramming will be explored. These ideas will be examined in the context of several different tissue systems and organisms.
Class Notes: Course meets Wednesdays, September 20 through November 15. Classes will be held at Karp Family Research Building, 7th floor conference room.
