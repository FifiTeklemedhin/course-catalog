Human Rights as History
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
The U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights has thirty articles, among them the more familiar —"life, liberty, and security of person" —and the less familiar —the right to a family, to cultural life, to rest and leisure. We often presume that human rights need no justification or explanation. But what are human rights? Are they really universal? We begin our course by looking at the origins of the concept itself. Some historians see human rights as the
brainchild of the American and French Revolutions; others see them as an alternative system born at the end of the Cold War in frustration with

traditional national and party politics. After analyzing the development of this idea over time, we'll think about how human rights are (or are not) protected. We'll draw on A Problem from Hell, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, who argues that powerful countries have a moral responsibility to prevent genocide. Power addresses examples such as the Rwandan genocide (where the U.S. failed to intervene) and the Balkan Wars (where NATO did intervene). But other experts say that intervention just makes suffering worse. When and why should a foreign power intervene to protect human rights? In the final unit, we will dig into several ongoing and highly contested issues in human rights, like the "right to be forgotten," which would force Google to erase certain unwelcome search results; the race-, religion-, and gender-infused debate over whether Muslim women should be allowed to wear headscarves in public spaces in France; Ta-Nehisi Coates's argument in The Atlantic for reparations to the descendants of black American slaves; and the growing debates over transgender rights and restroom access.

Existentialism
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
"Existence precedes essence." According to Jean-Paul Sartre's slogan, we are not born with a purpose given to us by god, human nature, or society, but are instead "condemned to freedom," to create ourselves through the choices we make. In our first unit, we will grapple with the idea that we create our own values, reading Sartre's lecture "Existentialism Is a Humanism," and consider a recent philosopher's attempt to understand what it means to describe life as absurd. Concerned as they were with concrete situations, existentialists also produced a great deal of literature in addition to philosophy. In our second unit, we will look at the concept of being-for- others—the idea that we never exist as pure individuals—in Sartre's play "No Exit" (bearer of the famous line "hell is other people") and a short story by his lifelong intellectual partner Simone de Beauvoir. Finally, at the end of
