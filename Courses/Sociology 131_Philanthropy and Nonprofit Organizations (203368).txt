         Most moral and religious frameworks uphold some form of benevolence and charity. However, societies have different ways of thinking about the roles of philanthropy and nonprofit organizations. This course investigates the nature of philanthropy and nonprofit organizations, as well as their influence on civil society. We will consider different sociological approaches to charitable giving and apply them to substantive topics, such as competing philosophies of giving and the relationship between philanthropic and state-sponsored programs. We will also address issues of social responsibility that arise when billionaire and corporate actors engage in philanthropic work. As a culminating active learning exercise, students will work in groups to identify and evaluate nonprofits as potential donation recipients, and will assess the impact a donation would make for those organizations. Student groups will have a unique opportunity to decide how to disburse a grant provided by the Philanthropy Lab to nonprofits, and to experience first-hand the dilemmas donors face as they evaluate nonprofits for donation.
