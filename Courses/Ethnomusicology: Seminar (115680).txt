Music and the Anthropology of Ethics and Morality. The seminar explores the literature on moral anthropology in conjunction with ethnomusicological case studies from Mali, Indonesia, Trinidad, and indigenous Canada. In the last ten years a burgeoning anthropology of ethics and morality has addressed in new ways longstanding issues of cultural relativism, diversity, resistance, and personhood. Building on Durkheim and Foucault, authors such as Zigon, Fassin, Laidlaw, Ortner, and others have drawn attention to the pluralist quality of moral diversity, the relationship of ethics and freedom, and the lived experience of morality and ethics in an ontological sense. At the same time scholars such as Weintraub, Rommen, Dueck, Diamond, Skinner, Shelemay, and Perman have raised ethical issues in ethnomusicology. The seminar convenes a conversation to synthesize and extend the insights of this literature.
