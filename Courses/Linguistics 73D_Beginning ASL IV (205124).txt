2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule:
Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: n/a
ASL IV course will build on the foundation set in the first three levels of ASL and will focus on expressive language at a more advanced level. Students will have an opportunity to play with the language and explore different literary genres including: classifier stories, narratives of personal experience, visual vernacular and ASL poetry. Given that language learning doesn't happen in isolation, we will continue our exploration of Deaf culture and norms in order to develop a deeper understanding of the Deaf community. Growing out of this discussion, students will learn what it means to work as an ally to the Deaf community and avoid oppressive behavior. Other issues to be discussed include recognizing audism in oneself and others and how to appropriately respond.
