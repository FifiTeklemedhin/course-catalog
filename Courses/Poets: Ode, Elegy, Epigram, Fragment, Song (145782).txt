Poetry, lyric and otherwise: how to read it, hear it, and write about it, from the 16th century to the present, with forms and models from Shakespeare, Keats and Dickinson to Herrera, Kasischke or Agbabi. Assignments include critical papers but also "imitation of great masters" (as Yeats put it); we'll study poems both in and out of the historical contexts that made them possible, and we'll ask why those that endure have endured.
