Many of us begin our day by reading online news and surfing Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. We follow what's going on and what our friends are doing online. Undoubtedly, media, especially social media, are now crucial to our social, political, and cultural lives. Events around the world—from the Arab Spring to the recent American presidential election—have also shown the importance of media in bringing about social and political change. This course explores the impact of the media—how they have transformed our means of communication, social interaction, news consumption, and political action. Reviewing a variety of theoretical and empirical perspectives, we will pursue the following questions, among others: To what extent and in what ways does social media drive political polarization? Is social media making us more or less social? How does social media help to organize collective action? Why can't people tell fake news from real? What are the consequences of fake news? Methodologically, we will cover how to conduct in-depth interviews, online ethnography, and content analysis. The purpose of the course is to give students the skills to do an empirical study of media, society and social change.
