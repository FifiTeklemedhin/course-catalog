Gives a more integrative understanding to sense of self using philosophical theories, neuropsychological quantitative cognitive tests, and neurological conditions involving self disorders. Considers two primary dimensions for sense of self: the diachronic self as based on memory and the synchronic self grounded in the body. Topics include personal identity, mind/brain reduction, first vs. third person perspective, phenomenology of self, introspection, quantitative vs. qualitative methods. Provides appreciation of the advantage of bringing together cross-disciplinary perspectives (neurological, philosophical, and psychological) and research methods (introspection, philosophical intuitions, psychometric tests, behavioral tests, empirical research, and clinical approach).
