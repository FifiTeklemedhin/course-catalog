Physical Sciences 12B
Electromagnetism and Statistical Physics from an Analytic, Numerical and Experimental Perspective (109457)
Melissa Franklin Anna Klales
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This is the second term of a two-semester introductory sequence that uses a combination of analytic and numerical methods to understand physical systems, to analyze experimental data, and to compare data to models. Topics include electrostatics and magnetostatics, electromagnetic fields, optics [all topics illustrated with applications to current technological and societal challenges], and an introduction to the physics of many-body systems and their aggregate properties such as entropy, temperature and pressure. The course is aimed at second year students who have an interest in pursuing a concentration in the sciences and/or engineering. The course structure includes lecture, discussion and laboratory components.
Course Notes: May not be taken for credit by students who have passed Physics 15b or Physics 15c. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General
Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.
