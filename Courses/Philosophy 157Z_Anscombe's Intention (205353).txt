         A close reading of Elizabeth Anscombe's short 1957 monograph Intention, a founding text in the philosophy of action, which propounds an anti-Cartesian, non-behaviorist, non-materialist account of intention and related psychological phenomena on the basis of detailed conceptual analysis. 'The most important treatment of action since Aristotle' (Donald Davidson).
