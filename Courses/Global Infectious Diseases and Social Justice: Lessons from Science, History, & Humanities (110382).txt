2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 60
This course will review the devastating impact of infectious diseases on wars, politics, economics, religion, public health, and society as reflected in history, literature, and the arts. We will study how infections spawned revolutionary epidemiologic and scientific advances in detection, treatment, and prevention. We will address the gaps between discovery and implementation, including ethical, social, economic, and health systems barriers to progress, as well as challenges posed by microbial adaptation to the immunce defenses and antibiotics.The disparate impact of infections on underserved and minority populations, and approaches to addressing such inequities, will be emphasized. By weaving together knowledge from science and the humanities, students will learn to address current and emerging global infectious disease threats and the social justice challenges they pose. Classes and sections will be highly interactive, including case studies, games, advocacy "pitches," a mock trial, debates, role playing, and collaborative learning.
