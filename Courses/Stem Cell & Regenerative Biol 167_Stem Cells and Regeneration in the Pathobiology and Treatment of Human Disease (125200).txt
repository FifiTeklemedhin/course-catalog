2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Stem cells are the basis for tissue maintenance and repair, thus, are essential elements of normal organ and tissue physiology. Stem cells are also targets for disease processes and through transplantation are important therapeutic agents. This course will allow advanced undergraduates to explore how stem cells and tissue regeneration impact human disease pathogenesis and how stem cells might be exploited to advance new therapies for disease.
