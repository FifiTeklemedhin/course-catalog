          In most of the world, the Cold War burned hot. This seminar explores how Soviet and American interventions, as well as their competing models of modernity and "development," overlapped with local concerns to determine the fate of societies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Simultaneously, we will analyze how the emergence of the so- called Third World –through decolonization and post-colonial revolutionary movements –challenged Western dominance in international politics. Eschewing the narrow, Moscow vs. Washington lens of Cold War history, we will put the Global South at the center and gain a fuller perspective on the origins of the 21st century.
