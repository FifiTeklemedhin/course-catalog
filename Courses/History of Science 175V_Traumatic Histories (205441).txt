         This seminar is aimed at advanced undergraduates interested in the history of psychiatry, trauma studies, and the traumatized subject as a recognizable clinical and social category. The course explores the troubled history of trauma psychiatry, focusing on the debates over the legitimation of various forms of suffering (in psychiatric terms) in different time periods. Our goals while exploring this history will be twofold: first, to understand how trauma as a precursor to mental pathology emerged as a way of understanding not only the survivor but also different kinds of disasters; and secondly, to understand the major moves and developments in trauma theory. Topics will include wartime trauma, the Holocaust, accidents, natural and human-caused disasters, sexual and gender based violence, abuse, the memory wars, and the extension of trauma theory to poverty and other forms of social vulnerability.
