This is advanced readings course focuses on a group of parasitic protozoa and helminths responsible for the highest burden of disease in developing countries. These include malaria, toxoplasma, leishmania, trypanosomes, amoebae, giardia and schistosomes. Weekly lectures from invited speakers will enhance critical readings of current literature and student-led discussions. Central themes in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases will be examined in the framework of the unique biology of eukaryotic parasites and their relationship to the host defense. Readings and discussions will emphasize experimental approaches and mechanism in parasitic infection from a molecular and cellular perspective. A final paper, in the format of a research proposal or a perspective articles, is required.
Course Notes: Course is offered during Spring 2, which runs from 3/19/18 to 5/11/18 Offered jointly with School of Public Health as IID 205.
