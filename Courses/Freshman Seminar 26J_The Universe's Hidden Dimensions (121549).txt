This seminar will give an overview and introduction to modern physics. As with the book, Warped Passages, on which it will be loosely based, the seminar will first consider the revolutionary developments of the early twentieth century: quantum mechanics and general relativity; and then it will investigate the key concepts which separated these developments from the physical theories which previously existed. We will then delve into modern particle physics and how theory and experiment culminated in the "Standard Model of particle physics" which physicists use today. Then we will move beyond the Standard Model into more speculative arenas, including supersymmetry, string theory, and theories of extra dimensions of space. We will consider the motivations underlying these theories, their current status, and how we might hope to test some of the underlying ideas in the near future.
