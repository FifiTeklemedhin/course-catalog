         This course introduces students to some of the central debates in contemporary English-language political theory, including questions of justice, equality and rights. We then turn to other topics reflecting the individual interests of students who enroll. Designed to help participants to make the transition from being critical readers of political thought to being independent contributors to debate, the course will be especially useful for those considering writing a thesis in political theory.
