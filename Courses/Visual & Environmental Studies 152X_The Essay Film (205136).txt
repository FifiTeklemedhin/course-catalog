The essay film is a loosely defined, wide-ranging genre of nonfiction. Students in the course will divide their time between studying and making works in this genre. We will see and discuss well known works, such as Man with the Movie Camera and Sans Soleil, as well as a variety of lesser known films, including those that test the limits of the genre. The practical assignments will center on using digital video to explore the possibilities of creating an essay using the motion picture medium.
