Laura M. Magnotti
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 16
The brain has evolved a unique but very effective system to protect itself from invaders. In this course, we will explore the specific defenses that the nervous system uses to protect itself. We will also examine how some pathogens evade or breach those defenses and the impact of those invasions. Finally, we will explore how scientists have been able to translate their understanding of these pathogenic mechanisms into technologies for research and therapeutic applications.
