         We will discuss how theoretical and experimental tools derived from physics - e.g., statistical mechanics, fluid mechanics - have been used to gain insight into molecular and cellular biology including the structure and regulation of DNA, genomes, proteins, the cytoskeleton, and the cell. Students will gain an intensive introduction to biological systems, as well as physical and mathematical modeling.
