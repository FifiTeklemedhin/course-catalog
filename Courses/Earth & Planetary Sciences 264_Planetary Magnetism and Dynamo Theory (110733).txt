Planetary Magnetism and Dynamo Theory (110733)
Jeremy Bloxham
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
An introduction to the generation of planetary magnetic fields by self-sustaining dynamo action. Magnetohydrodynamics: derivation of the induction equation from Maxwell's equations; the perfectly-conducting limit and frozen-flux; flux expulsion; diffusion and re-connection. Kinematic dynamo theory: Cowling's theorem; existence proofs; the Bullard-Gellman formalism; mean-field theories; fast dynamos. Dynamical considerations: the Navier-Stokes equation; rotating magnetoconvection; Taylor states; torsional oscillations and MAC-waves. Thermodynamic considerations: energy and entropy equations; the core heat flux problem. Numerical dynamo models.
