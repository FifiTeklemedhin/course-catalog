Bethany Burum
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 20
Why do our ideologies change when we are put in positions of power (e.g., victim dehumanization), or subordination (e.g., Stockholm Syndrome), or with peers with a different opinion (e.g., conformity)?Why are our moral and political ideologies so different across time and culture (e.g., the ideologies of ISIS members compared to Americans)? Why do we claim that our morals are logically justifiable when we cannot justify them (e.g., moral dumbfounding)? This course will explore the hidden incentives that can explain these and many other puzzling features of our beliefs and ideologies. Evidence from psychology, as well as philosophy, economics, history, and current events (including the election cycle), will demonstrate the crucial way that incentives outside of our awareness shape our beliefs and ideologies.
