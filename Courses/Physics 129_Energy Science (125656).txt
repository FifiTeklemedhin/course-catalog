Non-fossil energy sources and energy storage are important for our future. We cover four main subjects to which students with a background in physics and physical chemistry could make paradigm changing contributions: photovoltaic cells, nuclear power, batteries, and photosynthesis. Fundamentals of electrodynamics, statistical/thermal physics, and quantum mechanics are taught as needed to give students an understanding of the topics covered.
Recommended Prep: Physics 15a (or 16), 15b,c or 11a,b. Pre/co-requisite Physics 143a or Chemistry 160 or equivalent.
