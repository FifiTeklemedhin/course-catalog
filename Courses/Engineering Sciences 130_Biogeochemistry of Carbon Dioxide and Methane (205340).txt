Engineering Sciences 130
Biogeochemistry of Carbon Dioxide and Methane (205340)
Steven Wofsy
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MF 0230 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
A comprehensive study of the major carbon-containing gases in the atmosphere (CO2 and CH4), emphasizing biogeochemical processes in the oceans, land and atmosphere that regulate their global abundances, plus the human-controlled processes and multiple feedbacks that perturb them. Roles in energy balance, air chemistry and pollution, and stratospheric chemistry will be studied. The course emphasizes active learning, including hands on data analysis of global, regional, and ecosystem observations and creation of models for understanding the cycles and their responses to a changing environment. Students develop research projects throughout the course, and present them publicly in lieu of a final exam.
