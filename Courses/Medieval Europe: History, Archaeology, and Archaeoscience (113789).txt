From the ruins of the ancient world, women and men created a new civilization: Europe. Combining history, archaeology and science, this course examines the extraordinary transformations of belief systems, warfare, technology, law and government, business practices, food production, disease, environments, and climate in the Middle Ages, between the fall of Rome and the Italian Renaissance. Well-coached analysis of primary sources in translation and of your writing feature prominently. Themes include the spread of Christianity, the challenge of Islam, the Vikings, Crusades, feudalism, Europe's economic rise and the Black Death, and the new knowledge stemming from paleoclimate science and archaeogenetics.
