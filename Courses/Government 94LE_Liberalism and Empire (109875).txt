Can theories grounded in moral universalism and democratic principles legitimate imperial domination and intervention? Modern liberal political thought emerged in tandem with European expansion into the "new world" and then into Asia and Africa, generating both critics and supporters of imperialism. Focusing on the imperial impulse in Britain, France, and the United States, this seminar examines the conceptual connections between liberal democracy and empire in political thinkers from John Locke to Niall Ferguson.
