There are certain pictures we hold in our mind that represent injustice or justice. What images have had agency and persuasive efficacy in the contestation of racial inequality, civil rights, and social justice in the United States? How do we assess the impact of these works? This course, open to graduate students as well as undergraduates, examines photography that has both solidified and challenged the construction of racial categories and related civil rights cases in America. The course will focus on photographers including Joseph T. Zealy, Edward Curtis, Lewis Hine, Gordon Parks, LaToya Ruby Frazier, and Carrie Mae Weems and will focus on signal moments in the long Civil Rights movement. Classes will give students an opportunity for original archival research and will be held in the Harvard Art Museums with trips to the Peabody, Houghton, and the Gordon Parks archive.
