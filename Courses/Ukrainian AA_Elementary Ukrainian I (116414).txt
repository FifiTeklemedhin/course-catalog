2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 0900 AM - 0959 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
An introductory course in modern Ukrainian language and culture, designed for students without previous knowledge who would like to speak Ukrainian or use the language for reading and research. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Students are exposed to Ukrainian culture through work with prose and poetry as they learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research.
This year-long full course satisfies the foreign language requirement and prepares students for continued study of Ukrainian in intermediate-level courses and for study or travel abroad in Ukraine. Part one of a two-part series.
Course Notes:
Part one of a two-part series. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in Ukrainian AA in the fall and Ukrainian AB in the spring within the same academic year.
This course will also meet for an additional hour of speaking practice to be arranged the first week of classes.
