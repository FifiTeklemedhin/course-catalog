This course will examine three great traditions in medieval philosophy (Neoplatonism, Scholastic-Aristotelianism, and Nominalism) through each tradition's greatest proponent (Augustine, Aquinas, and William of Ockham). Specific topics will include skepticism, knowledge, human nature, divine nature, language, realism, conceptualism, and happiness. Students in the course will acquire a firm understanding of the major currents in one of the most important –if still neglected –periods in western philosophy.
