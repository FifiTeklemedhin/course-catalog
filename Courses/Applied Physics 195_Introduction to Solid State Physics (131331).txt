Schedule: Enrollment Cap:
WF 0100 PM - 0229 PM n/a
AP50b is designed specifically for engineering and physics majors and is equivalent in content and rigor to a standard introductory physics course for scientists and engineers (Physical Sciences 12a, Physics 15a), but focuses on the application of physics to real-world problems. Students must attend one 2-hour section on Friday. Section times will be assigned upon enrollment (9-11am, 11-1pm, 1-3pm, 3-5pm).
A solid knowledge of multivariable calculus at the level of Applied Math 21a or Math 21a is required. Mathematics 21a can be taken concurrently.

            The physics of crystalline solids and their electric, magnetic, optical, and thermal properties. Designed as a first course in solid-state physics. Topics: free electron model; Drude model; the physics of crystal binding; crystal structure and vibration (phonons); electrons in solids (Bloch theorem) and electronic band structures; metals and insulators; semiconductors (and their applications in pn junctions and transistors); plasmonic excitations and screening; optical transitions; solid-state lasers; magnetism, spin waves, magnetic resonance, and spin-based devices; dielectrics and ferroelectrics; superconductivity, Josephson junctions, and superconducting circuits; electronic transport in low-dimensional systems, quantum Hall effect, and resonant tunneling devices.
Course Notes: APPHY 195 is also offered as PHYSICS 195. Students may not take both for credit.
Recommended Prep: Elementary quantum mechanics. Additional Course Attributes:
