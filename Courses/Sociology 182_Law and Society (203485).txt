Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: "The life of the law is not logic, but experience." While law school curriculum focuses on legal doctrine, law-in-action often diverges from law-on-the-books. For instance, although civil rights laws make workplace discrimination illegal, such laws are not often enforced. This gap between law-on-the books and law-in-action has prompted social-legal scholars to examine the latter more closely. Adopting a law-in-action approach, this course examines the relationship between law and society. We will survey major theoretical perspectives and empirical studies that analyze the dynamics between law and legal institutions and their social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Topics that will be discussed include but are not limited to: (1) concepts and theories of law and society; (2) the experiences of different actors in the legal system, particularly, lawyers, judges, jurors, law enforcement agents, litigants, and citizens; (3) legal consciousness and legal culture; and (4) the relationship between law and social change. A major focus of the course will be civil rights. We will explore, for example, the extent to which court decisions on civil rights have brought about social change in the United States.
