Visual & Environmental Studies 261 Section: 1 Ecocritique and Popular Cinema (205289)
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: F 1100 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 20
Taking a broad view of the terms 'cinema' and 'popular', this course proposes methods for ecocritical research, implications of those methods, and hypotheses derivable from them. It develops advanced tools for criticism based on the principle that textual encounters are a privileged instrument of humanities research revealing unique constellations of ecocide, debt, digitisation and obligation. It seeks expression of environmental responsibility in blockbusters and animations amid the challenges of anthropocentrism, melancholia and socio-technical change.
Class Notes: There will be mandatory weekly film screenings for this class on Thursdays from 10am-12pm in the Carpenter Center Lecture Hall beginning on
