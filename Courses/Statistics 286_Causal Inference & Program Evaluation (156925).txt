The course will introduce students to the basic concepts of Causal Inference primarily under the Potential Outcome approach. It will then guide students through recent advances in causal inference for the analysis of both exprimental and observational studies. Topics will include: dealing with various "selection" problems or post- treatment complications, such as censoring due to death, noncompliance, missing outcomes, mediation analysis, through principal stratification; dealing with interference and estimation of spillover effects; sensitivity analysis to various identifying assumptions; different modes of inference for causal effects (moment- based, randomization- based, likelihood-based and Bayesian).The course will blend theory and application. Recent papers will be discussed, and participants will be encouraged to develop their own research problems in this active area. After finishing the course, students should have a solid understanding of the philosophy behind causal inference, the
