         Research suggests that the majority of US adults will experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime. What factors contribute to positive and negative mental health outcomes following such events? How do we best define what constitutes a "traumatic event"? How is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) most effectively treated? This course is a scientifically-based exploration of psychological trauma and PTSD. We will examine topics related to the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of trauma-related psychopathology, with a particular focus on empirical research.
