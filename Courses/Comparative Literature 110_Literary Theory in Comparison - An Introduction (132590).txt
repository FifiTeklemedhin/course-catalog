         This course explores the relationship between theory and practice in literary terms. What is "theory" and why should it concern itself with literature? We'll be positing that for literature, reading and writing are co-extensive: literary theory is part and parcel of the field it seeks to analyze; literature is continuously seeking to elaborate its own theory. During the semester, we will be reading literary theory as a literary genre and literary texts as reflections on theory. We will shed light on these questions through a range of literary and critical texts which we will bring into comparison. We will consider three pairings: first, Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando (1928) with her essay A Room of One's Own (1929); then, HonoreÃÅ de Balzac's short story Sarrasine (1830) with its extensive commentary by Roland Barthes in S/Z (1970); finally, Jose Luis Borges' anthology of short-story Fictions (1944) with Michel Foucault's The Order of Things (1966). By engaging with these six seminal works, the course offers a focused yet comprehensive overview of some of the issues debated by literary theorists: authorship, style, gender, class, interpretation, semiotics, inter-textuality, plurality, books, libraries, knowledge and language. The students will learn how any given reading of a literary work can in fact be read as a "theoretical" piece; and how, in turn, theoretical criticism might be fruitfully analyzed as a work belonging to literary writing.
