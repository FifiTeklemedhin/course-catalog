         In this course students will explore composition in multi faceted way. Each student is expected to come with joy towards experimenting and trying things out of their comfort zone. We will compose/ invent small pieces using self made objects, recordings, texts and will discover what it means to zero in on harmony or on rhythm or melody, orchestration, texture by individually exploring and experimenting. The class offers creative space to people who love composing whether they have a lot of experience or not. We will have class sessions and discussions and also about 4 individual sessions of 30 minutes for each student some weeks, replacing the class sessions. At the end of the semester we will have a concert with Parker String quartet accompanied by the class members.
