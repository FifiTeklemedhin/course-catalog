Mathematics 1A
Introduction to Calculus (123680)
Emily Braley
2018 Spring (4 Credits)
Instructor Permissions: None
Schedule: Enrollment Cap:
MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM n/a
The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz ranks among the greatest achievements of the past millennium. This course will help you see why by introducing: how differential calculus treats rates of change; how integral calculus treats accumulation; and how the fundamental theorem of calculus links the two. These ideas will be applied to problems from many other disciplines.
