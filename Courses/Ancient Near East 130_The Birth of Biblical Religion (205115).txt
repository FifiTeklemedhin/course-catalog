2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0830 AM - 0959 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The inscriptions found in recent decades "For YHWH and his Asherah" have created a heated debate about the birth of biblical religion. Was the Canaanite goddess Asherah indeed YHWH's consort? If so, when and how did the biblical God become a single and a jealous God as we see him in the Ten Commandments?And what about Moses and his share in the process? Is he an historical figure? Was he influenced by the Egyptian revolutionist Pharaoh Akhenaten as Sigmund Freud has argued in his book "Moses and Monotheism"?In this course, we will deal with these and other fundamental questions related to the Bible's beginnings. Based on new readings of biblical and Egyptian sources we will offer new ways to solve the mysteries involved in the birth of biblical religion.
