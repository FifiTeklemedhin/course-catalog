         Cities are central to cultural innovation, and access to the arts is often a defining aspect of the urban experience. Grounded in urban sociology and the sociology of culture, this course focuses on topics that span the intersection of urban culture, like neighborhood images, music scenes, street art, nightlife economies, and museums and cultural hierarchies, festivals, and tourism. Along the way, we will explore broader issues of urban life, like gentrification, growth machines, racial segregation, and the concentration of poverty, as well as perspectives on the production and reception of artistic work and cultural authenticity. Through a sequence of distinct projects and assignments, students will develop their expertise in least three modes of qualitative research: street interviews, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. Bring your walking shoes â€“this course will require a lot of thinking (and
