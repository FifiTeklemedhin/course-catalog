 Science A
             The course provides an overview of the energy resources that we use to sustain our global economies, and explores the impact of these activities on our environment. We address the full life cycle of each energy resource, including its origins, methods used to explore for and exploit it, how it is used in our economies, and the environmental impacts of these activities. Topics include coal, petroleum (conventional and unconventional), nuclear power, geothermal systems, and renewable energy options (hydro, tidal, solar, wind power). Lectures and labs will introduce students to data and methods used in these energy and environmental sectors.
