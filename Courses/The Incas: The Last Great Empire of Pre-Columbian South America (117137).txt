Gary Urton
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course guides students on an exploration of the largest and most complex civilization of Pre-Columbian America - the Inca Empire of Andean South America. We will address such questions as how did a civilization emerge and thrive at 12,000 feet above sea level? How could a state-level society exist without markets, the wheel, or writing? In addition to lectures and discussions, students will experience the products of Inca civilization through hands-on study of artifacts in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.
