         The 20th century was a momentous period in the history of physics. It witnessed the collapse of the classical certainties of the past and the emergence of startling new ideas about the nature of physical reality, from the special and general theories of relativity to quantum mechanics, the physics of subatomic particles, and cosmological theories of the structure and development of the universe. These new understandings helped give rise to remarkable technological applications, from nuclear weapons to lasers. In this course, we will study the ideas, events, and personalities that shaped physics in the 20th century. Of particular interest are the entanglements between physics and the social and political currents of modern historyâ€”from the maintenance of empire to the rise of totalitarianism, from world wars to the Cold War.
