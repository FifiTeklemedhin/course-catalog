The Worlds of Business in Modern China (108854)
William Kirby
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 60
China was home to the world's largest economy two centuries ago. Within two decades it will be the world's largest economy again. This course uses business as a lens through which to study modern China. Using new Harvard Business School cases, we explore traditional family firms and internet startups; state-owned enterprises and their private-sector challengers; and the catalytic role of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign enterprise in shaping contemporary China. Case studies cast light on larger themes: the role of party and government (national and local) in business and society; the legal environment; and the global impact of China's development.
