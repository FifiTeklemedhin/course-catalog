         How do theories of justice deal with the problem of housing? What use does American housing policy and politics make of ideas about "fairness" and "justice"? This course will juxtapose contemporary philosophical debates about distributive justice with current concrete problems in housing policy, using the Boston/Cambridge area as a case study. Seminars will feature guests from a number of local housing-focused organizations, and students' final papers will assess real housing policy examples in light of a chosen framework of justice. As this is an Engaged Scholarship course, preference will be given to students involved in direct service to housing-insecure populations (whether in shelters, the public schools, urban summer camps, etc.).
