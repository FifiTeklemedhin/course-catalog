Are You Now or Have You Ever Been an Android?: The New Materialism (204981)
Joyce Chaplin
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
Many historians now believe that the material and nonhuman elements of human life and experience should be foreground, not background. Humans and their histories exist, after all, within and in relation to nonhuman material entities and forces: animals, climate, androids, food, computer code, commodities, inanimate things, entire landscapes, and every other kind of stuff. Several fields from the human sciences and natural sciences have been important in establishing how our material worlds are fundamental to our identities, roles, beliefs, and futures. This course will explore dimensions of the new materialism, as it is playing out in interpretations of the past.
