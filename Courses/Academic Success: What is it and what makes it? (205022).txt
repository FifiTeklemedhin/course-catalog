2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 16
This course will focus on understanding the incredible diversity with which academic success is defined and measured, along with examining how factors at the individual and environmental levels uniquely and jointly facilitate or inhibit academic success from middle school through college. Honing into the tertiary level of education, timely topics such as the utility of SAT and GRE scores for college admission, the effectiveness of distance learning and MOOC courses, and the value of taking a gap year will also be critically analyzed.
