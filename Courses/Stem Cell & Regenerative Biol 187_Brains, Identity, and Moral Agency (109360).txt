Human beings experience a sense of self that provides a stable foundation from which to understand personal experience, consciously formulate goals, and initiate actions. The view that people act in accordance with freely formed intensions underlies important concepts of moral agency and culpability, yet evidence from neuroscience questions this assumption. This course will examine competing views of human agency grounded in concrete scientific examples to encourage reflection on the implications for identity and moral agency.
Course Notes: For students who have taken MCB 80, it is contemplated that there will be a section that incorporates more advanced concepts from neurobiology. This
course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Ethical Reasoning.
