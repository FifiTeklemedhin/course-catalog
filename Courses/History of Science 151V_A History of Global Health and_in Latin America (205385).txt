         This discussion-based class will introduce students to debates about the meaning of global health in a key region of the Global South: Latin America. We will concentrate on the reception and recreation of disease-eradication campaigns, as well as broad prevention programs and neoliberal public health reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 20th and turn of the 21st centuries. We will devote particular attention to Brazil and its creative responses to its public health challenges, its fight against AIDS and its relationship with African countries. Finally, we will look at ways in which international health organizations and Latin American actors have interacted during and after the Cold War.
