         The celebration of national and local forms of heritage often rides roughshod over the interests of the local citizenry it is intended to serve. In this course we look at how such conflicts play out in several cities - notably Athens, Bangkok, Beijing, Istanbul, Jerusalem and Rome - and address the ethical, practical, and architectural conflicts that arise from an anthropological perspective.
