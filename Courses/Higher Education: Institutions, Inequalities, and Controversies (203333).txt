 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         This undergraduate seminar explores modern higher education systems and institutions through sociological lenses. We will identify major issues and controversies in contemporary higher education policy and research â€“such
as rising student debt, inequality in access, grade- and degree "inflation", commercialization of higher education, and the increased bureaucratization of universities. We will explore these issues drawing on the seminal works and concepts of the sociology of higher education, such as the study of inequalities, college impact, universities as organizations, academic profession, higher education politics and higher education culture. This will be an opportunity to gain perspectives into established and emerging areas of research into higher education and insights into today's changing landscape in higher education in the United States and across the world.
