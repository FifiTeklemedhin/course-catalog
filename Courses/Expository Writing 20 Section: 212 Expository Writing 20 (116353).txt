the twentieth century, some critics even argued that art is only effective when it jolts us out of our customary ways of relating to the world, or when it makes explicit the structures of violence and oppression that operate invisibly. This course will begin by exploring works of art and literature by Michelangelo, Edouard Manet, and Charles Baudelaire that were considered transgressive in their time but which have since been incorporated into the canon of art history. Is an artwork deemed shocking because of its own intrinsic qualities, or because of the norms and values of its viewing culture? How did these creations and their controversies shape or redirect the course of art history? In our second unit, we will study some contemporary artists who understand "shock" to be an integral part of their aesthetic projects. In looking at Damien Hirst's pickled animal installations, or Tracey Emin's own stained mattress set in the middle of the Tate Gallery, or Kara Walker's provocative 75-foot-long sphinx made out of sugar, why do these artists want their audience to feel such alarm and unease? We will consider these artworks alongside readings by feminist critics, philosophers, and art theorists who defend art even at its most outrageous extremes. Can shock motivate moral or ethical reasoning? Is shock a particularly political feeling? And why are images or representations of the body so central to this genre of art? The third unit will investigate how institutions –like museums, the media, and even universities like Harvard –play a role in either canonizing transgressive art or else fanning the flames of public outrage. Students will have the opportunity to visit the Harvard Art Museum as they work on their final, individual research papers.

case, those who hold power cling to it at all costs, while those who feel oppressed or excluded fight to attain some power of their own. In most societies, power is concentrated in the hands of a select few, and even in the world's democracies, many citizens continue to feel powerless—the playthings of some distant and shadowy elite, or of grand political and economic forces beyond their control. In this course, we will consider some of the fundamental questions regarding the nature of power: Does power always have to be "power-over," with one group dominating the rest? Or is it possible for groups of people to generate "power-with," empowering themselves to act in pursuit of shared goals? Is power ultimately synonymous with violence, or wealth, or political authority? Is it possible to exercise power over culture and ideas in addition to people and resources? We will approach these questions through the methodological lenses of political science, sociology, anthropology, and history, while also considering examples drawn from documentaries and current events. In our first unit, we will establish working theories of power-over and power-with, and consider their application to both democratic and non-democratic contexts. In the second unit, we will refine our concept of power-over, testing it against studies of power and resistance in Appalachian mining communities, Malaysian peasant villages, and American low-income urban schools. We'll also take an in-depth look at a headline-making study that claimed to prove that America is more oligarchy than democracy. In the final unit, we'll revisit the concept of power-with by exploring the strategies that social movements like the Civil Rights Movement use to develop and exercise power, and conduct further research into contemporary movements like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter.
