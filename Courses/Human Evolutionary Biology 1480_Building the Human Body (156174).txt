Humans and our primate relatives display marked variation in biological traits. This variation results from natural selection operating on pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. While these mechanisms remain mostly unknown, recent advances in genetics, genomics, and developmental biology now allow us to begin to understand how evolutionary processes influence and are influenced by underlying developmental and genetic organization. This course explores these inter-relationships in the context of the primate paleontological record. We focus on the evolution of the post-cranial skeleton (i.e., the axial skeleton, girdles, and limbs) and craniofacial skeletons, and present studies that cast light on the mechanisms that underlie major transitions in human evolution.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the research seminar requirement for Human Evolutionary Biology and includes a mandatory laboratory section.
