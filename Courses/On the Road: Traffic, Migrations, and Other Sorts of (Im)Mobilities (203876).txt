The current global moment carries the mark of border-crossings and transgressions where not only people are on the move, but also ideas and images about them. The refugee, the migrant, and the terrorist - while itinerant figures of different orders - they all inspire particular narratives about what constitutes "human nature" and inhumane practices. This course explores the multiple meanings of mobility and stasis by examining the (dis)placement and circulation of people and things along with the (folk)tales that accompany "being on the road." New roads through rainforests can bring improved economic conditions to rural areas; they can also bring disease and environmental destruction. So-called "uncontacted" tribes still inhabit in parts of the Amazon rainforest and Bedouin tribes continue to trouble Middle Eastern states. These nomadic populations present a challenge to state politicians, in theory because they represent a nomadic legacy and the possibility of insurrection, along with the belief that they cannot coexist with the modern, fixed, nation-state. French thinkers Deleuze &Guattari write that "[h]istory is always written from the sedentary point of view and in the name of a unitary State apparatus, at least a possible one, even when the topic is nomads. What is lacking is a Nomadology, the opposite of a history." So what does a mobile history or global outlook sound like if not told from the sedentary point of view? How do our perspectives on movement inform notions (or realizations) of peace, war, progress, and development? And what does it mean to tell a tale in motion? From the side of the road and on the highway, who and what can move or stay -- as well as who can tell the tale -- has defined those people and things gain and maintain social value. Among the diverse array of authors and central figures for this course are: Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Miriam Camitta, Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Jodi Byrd, as well as historically heroic actors such as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass. We will also honor the thousands of unnamed refugees crossing state borders via land, air, and water every day. While the course has a focus on the Americas, Africa, (some readings on South East Asia) and European colonialism, the class discussions, presentations, and certainly the assignments provide space to examine migrations and mobilities on the global scale.
Readings and discussions will engage the topics of: spatial productions of power and knowledge-making; movement that occurs through terrestrial, aquatic, cyber and outer-space, border-crossings; disability studies; trans- national development projects and environmental disasters; nomads and refugees.
