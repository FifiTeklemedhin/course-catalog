An introduction to the ways in which the brain controls mental activities. The course covers the cells and signals that process and transmit information, and the ways in which neurons form circuits that change with experience. Topics include the neurobiology of perception, learning, memory, language, emotion, and mental illness. This year we are changing the way in which this material is taught by emphasizing more student participation through active learning techniques and by providing real-world experiences and hands-on demonstrations each week.
Course Notes: This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of Living Systems. The course is open to students
with little formal training in biology.
