2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
Can literature teach us how to live? We will read some lauded contemporary narratives that strive to answer this question, such as Junot Diaz's This is How You Lose Her (1996), Nick Hornby's How to be Good (2001), Mohsin Hamid's How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia (2013), and Eleanor Davis's How to Be Happy (2014). We will investigate the role and uses of literary guidance in our advice-saturated culture.
