         This class will take a space-specific and deeply collaborative approach to theater making. Our goal will be to interrogate, through readings (in history, theory and critique) and through practice (by making our own piece of theater) the contemporary drift toward "immersive" theatrical forms. Starting with Wagner's articulation of gesamkunstwerk –of theater as the Total Work of Art –and Adorno's blistering critique of it, we will trace thinking on immersive artistic and cultural forms and responses to them, throughout the modern and postmodern periods. Concurrent with our readings, we will look at contemporary immersive works, including Jim Findlay's Dream of the Red Chamber, Michael Counts's escape room Paradiso, and Punch Drunk's immersive juggernaut Sleep No More, alongside emerging theories and technologies of virtual and augmented reality.
Meanwhile, employing all of the theatrical tools at our disposal (light, sound, space, song, movement, dance, language) we will come together as a company to create a site specific immersive theater piece of our own with "nothing" at its core. Pairing an episode of the hit TV show "Seinfeld"- the "show about nothing" - with Cage's writing on "silence" and Sartre's writing on "nothingness," we will create a piece that both embodies and critiques the immersive theatrical form.
This is a class for performers, directors, writers, designers, dancers, choreographers and media artists who are game to participate across disciplines. We will incorporate Viewpoints training as part of our development process. Our class will culminate in a public performance of the piece we create.
