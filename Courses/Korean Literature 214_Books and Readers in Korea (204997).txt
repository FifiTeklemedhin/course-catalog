A seminar on Korean literature focused on reading literary texts through the lens of the practice of reading and the materiality of the book. Students will read Korean literature as metaphors of, windows onto, and performative sites of how writers express themselves as readers of textual objects. Some of the questions to explore include: What does the the physical makeup of the "book" (i.e. textual objects of various kinds including inscriptions, scrolls, codices, and writing in digital media) tell us about how people read, wrote, and viewed the world? What do literary texts tell us about what and how people read and created literature? Literary texts will be drawn from all periods, from earliest times to present-day Korea.
All readings are in English. No knowledge of Korean is required. Students will make trips to the Harvard-Yenching Library, Harvard Art Museums, Harvard Map Collections, and Houghton Library for hands-on experience.
