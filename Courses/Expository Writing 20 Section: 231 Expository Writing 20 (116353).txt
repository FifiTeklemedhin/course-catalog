Note –The "Engaged Scholarship" components of this course include three required meetings outside class time that have been tentatively scheduled in March and April: a panel discussion held on Harvard's campus with teachers from Brighton High (March 7 from 7:00-8:30 PM); a visit to Brighton High (students have the option of visiting on either April 5 from 7:45-10:45 AM or April 7 from 11:15 AM-2:15 PM); and a "Civics Fair" Hosted by the Harvard Ed Portal (April 28 from 10:30 AM-1:30 PM).
Over sixty years after the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" schools are unconstitutional, segregation is on the rise. Today, despite widespread evidence that integrated education increases student learning and reduces prejudice, American public schools are increasingly divided by class and race. In this course, we investigate attempts to achieve educational equality in Boston, focusing on the decision to use busing to desegregate the public schools in the 1970s and the wave of violent opposition that followed. Throughout the semester, we undertake "engaged scholarship," combining academic learning and community engagement by collaborating with Bostonians directly affected by these historical events— we partner with history teachers and students at a neighborhood high school in the Boston Public Schools (BPS) system—and by focusing on communication with diverse audiences through writing, speaking, and visual presentation. To ground our understanding of the complex issues we will wrestle with, we begin with a journalist's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of school integration in the 1970s, contrasting the perspectives of black and

white families. We next examine historical debates on the causes of the "antibusing" movement and pedagogical debates about how to teach controversial and contested historical topics. For the final project, we have the opportunity to further investigate these topics and other current challenges around educational equity facing BPS. In thoughtful collaboration with our community partners and through research, we design lesson plans for a high school course on desegregation and prepare arguments for why the various plans might be effective. We not only delve into the remarkable written and visual materials in Harvard's libraries but also conduct conversations with teachers and students at Brighton High. The class culminates in a "Civics Fair" (held at Harvard's Education Portal serving residents of the Allston and Brighton neighborhoods) in which students present their lesson plans and engage with our partners at Brighton High and other community members.

Breaking the Rules
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Everyone lives by rules, no matter how free they may feel. Some of these rules are written; others are unspoken. While we typically associate political rights with what it means to be "free," the seemingly small social conventions of everyday life can limit our real or perceived liberties in powerful ways, too. The codes of conduct we follow when, for example, we use social media, when we go on dates, or when we work for a company all have the capacity to rein us in, and if we knowingly or unknowingly violate those norms, our freedom may be at the price of our membership in a community. This course will use literature and film to interrogate the relationship between social rules and individual freedom while considering the following questions: What does it really mean to be "free"? How does social obligation impact our access to personal freedom? Are we even aware of the ways that society controls our behavior, or are rules of social conduct largely invisible? As we seek the answers to these questions, we'll
