Divine Comedies: Graduate Seminar (130910)
Nicholas Watson
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
A study of four poetic and/or visionary works written 1300-1400: Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, John of Morigny's Book of Flowers, Julian of Norwich's Revelation of Love, and William Langland's Piers Plowman. We consider the inter-relationship between the poetic and the visionary in light of the categories of "orthodoxy" and "discretion of spirits" during a period when both were fiercely contested.
