Life Lessons from Professional Killers: What We Can Learn from the Samurai (205026)

2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0300 PM - 0459 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Is it possible to fail successfully? Should we be more beholden to the needs of others or to our own ambitions? Is there a set moral standard by which we should live our lives? What should we be prepared to sacrifice for higher goals—and what if pursuing those goals causes suffering to others? When should we take a risk? Is there such a thing as an ideal human being? Questions such as these have animated the figure of the samurai for nearly a millennium, captivating imaginations both in Japan and around the globe. What is it about this figure that speaks to some of our deepest questions about how to live a model human life? In this seminar, we will explore together the many meanings people have invested in the Japanese warrior, from medieval epics to kabuki plays, modern novels to propaganda, manga and anime to global cinematic blockbusters. (Tom Cruise, anyone?) Our focus will be less on the historical realities of the samurai than on the ways people have chosen to imagine them—and to what ends. In the process, we will consider what we ourselves might learn from this complex, fraught, appealing, and possibly dangerous figure. Our "life lessons" from the samurai will include (among others), "How to be a spectacular failure," "How to face the consequences of your actions," "How to justify your existence," "How to get revenge," and "How to make your brand go global."
