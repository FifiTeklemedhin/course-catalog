2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Crime fiction is one of literature's most popular genres, with hundreds of millions of fans across the globe. Both local and foreign crime fiction, the latter often in translation, flies off bookshelves from Boston to Barcelona to Beijing and beyond, regardless of whether the novel takes place in a small Swedish village or in multiple cosmopolitan megacities. Why is this? Part of it is in the storytelling. Who can resist a gripping whodunit with unexpected twists and turns and often with an appealing investigator or detective (professional or amateur), particularly if everything is resolved at the end, and often in ways we least expect? But part of the appeal of crime fiction is also the insights this genre can offer into some of the most significant challenges facing societies globally. In this course we will read a selection of bestselling crime fiction from the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. We will be most concerned with what this literature tells us about investigating, exposing, and potentially ameliorating historical crimes, environmental crimes, corruption in criminal justice, and social disintegration, particularly as these involve injustices inflicted on marginalized and otherwise vulnerable individuals and communities, people targeted on account of their class, ethnicity, gender, race, religion, sexuality and other factors. Secondary readings and class discussion will provide the necessary cultural and literary contexts for these readings.
