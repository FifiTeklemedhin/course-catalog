The goal of this graduate seminar is to develop an introductory undergraduate lecture course on "deep history," an approach that combines findings drawn from archaeology, anthropology, and history into a single historical narrative spanning the entirety of the human past. The seminar will have two main elements. The first features readings in the historical, archaeological, and anthropological literature that offer devices for framing the deep human past (e.g. universal history, four-field anthropology, and "Big History"). The second is dedicated to developing and workshopping graduate-student-designed teaching modules that will form the core of a spring 2018 course.
Class Notes: This course is also offered through the Anthropology Department as Anthropology 2059. Credit may be earned for either History 2059 or
