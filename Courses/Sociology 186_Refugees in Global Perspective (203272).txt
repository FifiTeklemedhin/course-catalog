Sociology 186
Refugees in Global Perspective (203272)
Danilo Mandic
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0200 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The recent influx of Middle Eastern refugees into Europe has caught citizens and policy-makers off guard. Yet such waves will continue to rock our globalized world in coming decades: massive movements of forced migrants will be "the new normal." Why is the world producing so many refugees? How are they displaced? Where do they travel, and why? This course will inquire into the nature, causes and consequences of contemporary refugee waves in our globalized world. Students will survey regional dynamics in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and North America. We will examine the particularities of refugees (compared to other migrants) and the changing nature of forced migration since the Second World War. Students will explore historical precedents to contemporary waves, learn about different host society approaches to asylum, compare government and criminal mechanisms of forced migration, and examine the reasons refugees are the object of increasing suspicion and hostility around the world. Particular attention will be paid to the recent EU crisis, the role of refugee camps in the 21st century, and alternative strategies for global asylum management by bridge and destination countries.
