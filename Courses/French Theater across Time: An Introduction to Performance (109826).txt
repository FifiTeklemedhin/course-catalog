Aims to help students, including those who are genuine novices in acting, to understand and experience theater as a form of physical expression that evolve as aesthetic and ideological contexts change across time. Readings include the most famous French playwrights of both the early modern age (MolieÌ€re, Corneille, Racine) and the later 20th / early 21st centuries. We explore how theater is used to interrogate questions such as sexual taboos, social injustices, or political engagement. Special emphasis paid to the power of performance through practical workshops and videos of recent productions. The final project consists of an excerpt to be performed in French.
