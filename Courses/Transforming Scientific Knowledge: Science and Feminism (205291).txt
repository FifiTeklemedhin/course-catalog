         How have feminism and gender theory influenced the practice of science? What are feminist methodologies, and how do they shape research agendas in fields such as genetics, human biology, biotechnology, and medicine? How do ethical questions intersect with the research process, including questions of who conducts research and who participates? We will explore how working scientists use gender analysis to shape research choices, frame hypotheses, and re-imagine the structure of scientific inquiry. Assignments will allow students to explore areas of interest in depth, with the final project including an option to design and outline their own research project.
