         In the name of "progress," science is constantly reshaping the economic, legal, and moral fabric of our lives. However, all great scientific advances have been met with resistance from some segment of the public, whether due to threats to established financial interests or through cultural shocks which challenge the existing social order. What are the common features of these panic-promoting innovations? Do they create new social cleavages or exacerbate existing ones? Can we reach a consensus about whether research is unethical or simply unprecedented? How do social contestations around knowledge eventually become resolved? This course reviews some of the most (in)famous historical backlashes against scientific advances - from consequential breakthroughs in disease control to the stuff of science fiction. Along the way we'll cover crucial case studies relating to sexuality, race, and the environment. After examining major themes and debates together, students will choose their own controversy to analyze and explain through a series of short paper assignments and a final report.
