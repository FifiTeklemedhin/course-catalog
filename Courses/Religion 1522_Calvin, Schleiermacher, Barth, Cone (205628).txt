John Calvin, Friedrich Schleiermacher and Karl Barth are major figures of Reformed Protestantism whose work directly engaged the political and intellectual concerns of their own times. In the 1970s, James Cone's Black Theology took its point of departure, in part, from Cone's critique of Barth. This course will closely read each author, looking at similarities and differences in how they approach theological topics (e.g., God, human being, scripture, nature, salvation, church). Throughout, we will consider what these four projects can teach us both about the "tradition" of Reformed theology and the task and responsibility of theology more generally.
