Mathematics 21A
Multivariable Calculus (119196)
John Cain
2018 Spring (4 Credits)
Instructor Permissions: None
Schedule: TBD Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course is recommended over Math 21b for those planning to concentrate in the life sciences and ESPP. Can be taken with Mathematics 21a. Students who have seen some multivariable calculus can take Math 19b before Math 19a. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
A course in one variable calculus preferably at the level of Mathematics 1b.
Not to be taken in addition to Mathematics 21b or Applied Mathematics 21b.

             To see how calculus applies in practical situations described by more than one variable, we study: Vectors, lines, planes, parameterization of curves and surfaces, partial derivatives, directional derivatives and the gradient, optimization and critical point analysis, including constrained optimization and the Method of Lagrange Multipliers, integration over curves, surfaces and solid regions using Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, divergence and curl of vector fields, and the Green's, Stokes's, and Divergence Theorems.
Course Notes:
This is a lecture taught in small sections. May not be taken for credit by students who have passed Applied Mathematics 21a. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. Activities using computers to calculate and visualize applications of these ideas will not require
