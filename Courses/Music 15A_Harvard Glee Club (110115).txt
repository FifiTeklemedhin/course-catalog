             Harvard Glee Club (TTBB Choir). As the nation's oldest collegiate chorus, the Glee Club is a tenor and bass ensemble exploring music written in the male chorus tradition. The Glee Club performs throughout the year, collaborating with arts groups on campus and at other universities, and across the world on annual tours. Through excellence in performance, student-management, education, community, tradition, and philanthropy, the Glee Club offers a unique musical experience for all members. The Glee Club frequently combines with the Collegium and the Choral Society, as well as the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, to perform large-scale works. Students must complete both parts of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year in order to receive credit.
