In recent years, foundations like the Gates Foundation and wealthy individuals like Mark Zuckerberg have become heavily involved in funding K-12 education, giving large sums of money to urban school districts, charter schools, and other education entities. This course will examine foundation involvement in education policy, with a focus on current education reform efforts. We will first track the evolution of foundation giving to education causes in the United States. We will them train our focus on current education reform efforts and foundation involvement, addressing philanthropy and school choice, foundations and federal education reform efforts, and how foundations have shaped education in big cities.
