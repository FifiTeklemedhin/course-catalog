agree or disagree with this pronouncement, but do you know why Shakespeare matters to so many people? Why does every high school in America assign Shakespeare? Why did the world erupt with jubilation on his 450th birthday in April 2014? Why did the British government pay $2.4 million to have Shakespeare translated into Mandarin? Does Shakespeare deserve all this fuss, or is he really overrated? In this section, Shakespeare lovers and haters alike are invited to consider the question of Shakespeare's popularity by looking into the relationship between his methods of artistic creation and the values of the modern world. We'll begin with a reading of the most famous artwork of the past millennium, Hamlet, a play about a bad philosopher trying to avenge his father's murder. Then we'll read one of Shakespeare's least popular plays, Henry VI (about feuding English families during a bloody civil war), alongside one of the most popular TV shows right now, Game of Thrones (which, like Henry VI, was based on the Wars of the Roses). We'll also read Henry VI in light of some controversial recent computer-based scholarship arguing that Shakespeare actually didn't write much of the play. Finally, we'll ask, "Why Shakespeare?" and entertain answers ranging from the cynical (Shakespeare is a dead, white male that other dead, white males have used to promote the values of dead, white males) to the euphoric (Shakespeare is universal; Shakespeare invented the human).

Reading the Body
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
What does it mean—and what has it meant—to have a body? Is a body a physical boundary separating a self from the rest of the world? If so, how do we account for cases like contagion or reproduction, where bodies implicate one another? How does the way we think about our bodies depend upon both the technologies we use to manage, diagnose, and measure them and the artistic forms we use to represent them? We'll begin to explore these

questions by visiting the Warren Anatomical Museum and the Putnam Gallery to examine Harvard's morbidly fascinating collections of medical curiosities and instruments—which include phrenological models of the brain, fetal skeletons, medical diagrams and prints, early X-ray machines, Civil War surgical instruments, and even Phineas Gage's skull. In our second unit, we will read across the boundaries of theology, literature, and science—genres we usually imagine as distinct—to understand how writers from a range of perspectives have grasped and represented the origin, construction, and development of the human body. We will examine the works of Jean Baptiste de Lamarck, William Paley, and Charles Darwin and analyze A. S. Byatt's treatment of their debate in her novella, "Morpho Eugenia." This interest in how the body has been understood in the past will inform your final research paper, where you will analyze representations of the body in the contemporary texts or contexts of your choice. Possibilities include (but are not limited to) disease films, modern dance, nude portraiture, college athletics, fitness magazines, and advertising.
Throughout the semester, we will ask how and why the body has been theorized in such conflicting ways, calling into question any singular understanding of what constitutes a human body.

Gothic Fiction
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Horror, madness, monstrosity, death, disease, terror, evil, and weird sexuality: these preoccupations, according to a recent critic, have animated Gothic fiction ever since it emerged in the mid-1700s. We will contemplate these preoccupations as we examine a range of Gothic texts from eighteenth-century Gothic fragments to stories by Edgar Allan Poe and Isabel Allende. And we will ask these questions about those texts: What makes Gothic fiction "Gothic"? How do we account for its immense popularity? Why have high-minded readers and writers always tended to scorn it? (What are they so worried about?) And what have modern Gothic
