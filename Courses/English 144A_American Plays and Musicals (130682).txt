This lecture on Golden Age Broadway considers both plays and musicals together. Readings pair shows on similar themes, including Death of a Salesman and The Music Man, Mister Roberts and South Pacific, and The Miracle Worker and My Fair Lady. We will attempt to understand not only the individual shows but also how Broadway operates as a theatrical system.
