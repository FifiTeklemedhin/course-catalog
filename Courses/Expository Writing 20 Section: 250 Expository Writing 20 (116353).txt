For most of human history, surgery has been a brutal, terrifying affair. Operations were carried out as quickly as possible to the sound of blood- curdling screams, and often ended in the patient's death. Historian of medicine Martin Pernick observed of surgeons before the advent of anesthesia that "the emotional ability to inflict vast suffering was perhaps the

most basic of all professional prerequisites." To say the state of the art has advanced since then is an understatement—incredibly, it is now even possible for complex surgeries to be carried out by robot, directed remotely by surgeons hundreds of miles away. Yet whether the scalpel is wielded by robotic arms or flesh-and-blood hands, it remains the case that operations are performed by human beings who are fallible, on bodies that are mortal, and there is still no way to wholly eliminate risk. As the surgeon and writer Atul Gawande has put it, when you are sick, "it's not science you call upon but a doctor." It is this fundamentally human endeavor of surgery, always rooted in specific social and historical contexts, that is the subject of this course. We begin the semester with historical and present-day accounts of surgical success and failure to explore what surgery has demanded from practitioners and patients over time. We next examine a major bioethical debate in one of the fields of surgery that has generated the most controversy and soul-searching throughout its history in societies around the world: organ transplantation. Lastly we consider an array of very different types of surgery that can significantly affect one's identity, self-presentation, and social position, such as cosmetic, bariatric, gender reassignment, and cochlear implant surgeries. Through independent research projects on related surgical phenomena of their choice, students will explore how the advent and availability of certain types of surgery in particular contexts has shaped social norms, concepts of the normal and the pathological, prevailing principles of medical ethics, and individual experience and self- understanding. What constitutes necessity, medical or otherwise? What should we be empowered to choose—and how far should we be allowed to go? What are the implications of responding to social problems not with social action, but with a surgeon's knife?
