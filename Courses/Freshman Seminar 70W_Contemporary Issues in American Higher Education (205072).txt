         Issues fundamental to society regularly play out on the campuses of America's colleges and universities. For example, how should a community react to speech that some members may find offensive? To symbols or traditions that speak to the institution's past but may be alienating to parts of its current student body? Is a college or university justified in considering race in admissions, or is that unfair discrimination? Should institutions invest their endowments to serve specific public policy goals, such as divestment from fossil fuel companies as a statement about climate change, or does that convert them into political actors inconsistent with their mission and obligation to create vibrant space for academic discourse? As you join the Harvard academic community, this seminar is designed to orient you to higher education and issues that often arise on and about college and university campuses. We will look at topics normatively, asking less what the rules are and more what they ought to be. The seminar's ultimate goal is to introduce you to the nature and values of the peculiar institutions that are America's college and universities and to begin to help you understand more fully the world that will help shape your lives over the next four years.
