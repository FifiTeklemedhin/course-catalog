How does one balance the demands of "politics" with the subtleties of "artistry?" In this course, we'll write and analyze short stories, paying close attention to key writing concepts such as characterization, voice, point of view, dialogue, and setting, while also investigating thematic issues related to women, gender, and sexuality studies. In addition, we'll read secondary readings by authors such as Audre Lorde, Dorothy Allison, and Adrienne Rich that illuminate the ways in which issues of power, agency, and voice have emerged as key themes in feminist writing. Frequent writing assignments, including written evaluations of peers' stories.
