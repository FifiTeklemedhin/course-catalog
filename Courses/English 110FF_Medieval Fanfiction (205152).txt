Fanfiction is a surprisingly powerful tool for examining medieval literature. It sheds light on the dynamics of reception and rewriting that characterize medieval texts, which in turn deepen our own understanding of creative originality. In this course we will read some twentieth- and twenty-first century fanfiction from popular fandoms with medievalist themes such as Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, alongside medieval 'fanfiction', including Arthurian romances, medieval 'sequels' to the Aeneid and the Canterbury Tales, and Christian spiritual texts in which women mystics imagined themselves as 'extras' in scenes from the Gospels.
