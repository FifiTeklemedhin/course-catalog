         This course focuses on the rise of class divisions among Black Americans. The effects of structural constraints on blacks' social and geographic mobility and how that resulted in a sense of "shared fate" will be the focus of the first portion of the course. The divergence of black people's material conditions as a result of the successes of the Civil Rights Movement, and the impact of factors such as black flight, deindustrialization and spatial mismatch of employment will be discussed. Other topics include changes in blacks' patterns of support for public policy options, divergences in their experience of mass incarceration, education and employment opportunities, and continuing similarities in academic underachievement. The conclusion of the course examines the roots of intergenerational poverty and considers the possibility that the gap between the two groups will continue to widen.
