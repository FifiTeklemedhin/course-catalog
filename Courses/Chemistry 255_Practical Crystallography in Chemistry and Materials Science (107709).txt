Due to great technical advances, crystal structure analysis plays an increasingly important role in the structure determination of complex solids. This course involves the basic principles of crystallography and covers advanced aspects of practical crystal structure refinement. Topics include crystal symmetry, space groups, geometry of diffraction, structure factors, and structure refinement. Students will gain a working knowledge of x-ray crystallographic techniques, including how to: grow quality crystals, collect data, reduce data, determine a structure, visualize structure, utilize structural databases, publish crystallographic results.
