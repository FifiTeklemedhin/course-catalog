2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
International humanitarian organizations are often first on the scene when armed conflicts erupt or natural disasters strike, but their efficiency and legitimacy are constantly questioned. This course examines humanitarian activism from a sociological perspective by looking at its history and its role in contemporary society. We will examine the origins of organized humanitarian activism and the dilemmas and challenges that NGOs must often face. We will investigate the consequences, justifications, and limitations of humanitarian work, focusing substantively on several case studies including the Kosovo War, the Nigerian Civil War, and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. The course will conclude with presentations based on students' independent research and exploration of an applied topic from the course.
