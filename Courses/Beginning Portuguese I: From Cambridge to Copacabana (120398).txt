Intended for those with no prior experience in the target language, this course emphasizes interpersonal communication as well as the interpretation and production of written and spoken language. Students take their first steps on the journey from speaking English to carrying conversations with Portuguese speakers over the course of one semester, thanks to immersion activities and dynamic, interactive learning. Students will be exposed to contextualized Luso-Afro-Brazilian culture through music, film, social media, as well as via Teletandem, a weekly online interaction with college students in Brazil, unique to the Portuguese Program.
