The seminar will study illustrated manuscripts that were produced in the Byzantine world from the 9th to the 15th century. Most of them are books, which contain religious texts: Old Testament, Gospels, Psalters etc. Several are treatises on a variety of subjects as well as of a historical nature. Some were produced at the imperial court workshops, many at monastic foundations and others in artists' ateliers. Many were however for personal use. The type or choice of illustration varied according to period, function and patron. All these questions will be addressed during the course of the semester.
