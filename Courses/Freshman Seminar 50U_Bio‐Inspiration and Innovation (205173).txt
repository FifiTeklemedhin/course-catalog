In the course of evolution, Nature has developed strategies that endow biological processes and materials with exquisite selectivity, specificity, and adaptability to a constantly changing environment. Learning from and mastering Nature's concepts not only satisfies humankind's insatiable curiosity for understanding the world around us, but also promises to drive a paradigm shift in modern materials science and technology. This seminar will explore some of the basic principles of biological architectures and the economy with which biology solves complex problems in the design of novel materials. It will give us a taste of how the inspiration from nature teaches us to break barriers in technology and disruptively innovate. Often nature's solutions to engineering problems are so different from our conventional ways of thinking that the most fruitful way to investigate them is not immediately obvious. We will be therefore engaged in a continuous dialogue: we study the biological material itself to begin to understand its underlying principles, adapt these concepts to design a bio-inspired architecture, and then apply insights from the designed system to guide further investigation of the biological system. The goal is to use biological principles as guidance in developing new, bio-inspired materials and devices, with broad implications in fields ranging from architecture to energy efficiency to medicine.
