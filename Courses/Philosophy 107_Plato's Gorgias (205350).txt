 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         A detailed study of Plato's third-longest dialogue. Particular attention will be paid to (i) the interaction between the overt philosophical content of the what the characters say and what Plato reveals through the unfolding drama; (ii) Socrates' apparent moving-away from the 'intellectualist' moral psychology presupposed in many shorter 'Socratic' dialogues, in the direction of an acknowledgement of the reality of akrasia and other forms of intrapsychic conflict; and (iii) the vivid and alarming presentation by Callicles of an aggressively skeptical response to Socrates' and the many's conceptions of justice.
