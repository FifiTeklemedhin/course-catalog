         This general microbiology course will focus on the genetics, cell biology, and physiology of microorganisms. The goal of this course is to give the students a broad overview of microbial physiology in the context of disease and environmental applications. The course will primarily consist of lectures with problem sets; we will also incorporate current and classical literature.
