Mathematics 55a is an intensive course for students having significant experience with abstract mathematics. Every effort will be made to accommodate students uncertain of whether the course is appropriate for them; in particular, Mathematics 55a and 25a will be closely coordinated for the first three weeks of instruction. Students can switch between the two courses during the first three weeks without penalty. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
Commitment to a demanding course, strong interest in mathematics, and familiarity with proofs and abstract reasoning.
