         An introduction to the interaction between hormones and behavior, emphasizing research in humans. General principles of endocrine physiology are presented. The course then focuses on how hormones affect the brain and body in early development and later in adulthood, and the relationship of hormones to sex and gender. We will explore human reproduction, energy metabolism, mating and sexuality, parental behavior, stress, and dominance interactions.
