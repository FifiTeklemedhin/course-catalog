 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
         This class uses photography to explore our expectations of the medium and to expand its possible applications. Students develop an independent work practice that is an extension of their own interests. Students will develop ideas for a project proposal at the outset of the semester and build a group of related photographs throughout the semester. The class will be organized around class discussions, critiques and individual meetings with the instructor. Slide presentations and readings will be given to deepen your understanding of the history of photography and contemporary art practices.
Course Notes: Interested students must attend first meeting of class to speak with teaching staff about enrollment procedures.
Recommended Prep: At least one previous photography course in VES or the permission of the instructor.
