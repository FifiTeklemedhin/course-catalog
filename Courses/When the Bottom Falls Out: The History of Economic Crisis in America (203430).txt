This course engages in an interdisciplinary inquiry into the checkered history of economic crisis in America, spending each week analyzing the circumstances surrounding (and consequences arising from) twelve of the most spectacular economic catastrophes in American history: the panics/ depressions/recessions of 1785, 1792, 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, 1938, 1973, and 2008. Assigned readings will span both philosophical and theoretical works on economic crisis; monographs in business, economic, and labor history; primary sources in art, literature, music, and oral history; and recent work in contemporary economics, political science, and legal studies.
