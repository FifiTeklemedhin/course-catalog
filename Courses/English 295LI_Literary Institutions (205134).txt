         This class examines the state as a category of analysis, particularly in relation to the new institutional turn in literary studies. Subjects will include war and militarism, sovereignty, law, welfare, infrastructure, empire, social apparatuses, the university, and our own disciplinary formation. Our readings will come largely from the 20th- and 21st-century: they will likely include works by Adichie, Ballard, Dangarembga, Orwell, and Woolf; as well as theory by Arendt, Agamben, Gramsci, Fanon, Foucault, Nancy, and Rankine. Expect to write in a number of scholarly genres, including the paper abstract, book review, and conference presentation.
