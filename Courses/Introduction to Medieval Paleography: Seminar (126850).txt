This bi-weekly workshop will train participants to read medieval handwriting from a variety of text-types, regions, and periods, and to recognize and decipher the abbreviations commonly used by medieval scribes. While the workshop's focus will be on Latin paleography, some vernacular texts will be examined as well. Students will be required to transcribe from manuscript samples in facsimile, as well as original documents in Harvard's Houghton Library, throughout each semester. Successful completion of both units of this workshop fulfills the Medieval Studies graduate secondary field requirement in paleography.
Course Notes: This is part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in
both the fall and spring course within the same academic year.
