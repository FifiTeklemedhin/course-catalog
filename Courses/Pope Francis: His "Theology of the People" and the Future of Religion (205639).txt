Harvey Cox
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0400 PM - 0559 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
Francis is the first pope in nearly two thousand years from outside Europe; the first to take the name "Francis;" the first Jesuit. Since his selection in 2017 he has become widely popular all around the world, but also bitterly opposed. What impact will his papacy have on the future of Christianity and religion in general?In this seminar, we will examine together some biographical material on Frances and ask how his earlier life and intellectual and theological influences, including liberation theology have shaped his papacy; his peace-making efforts; his attempts to reform the Vatican and to reorient the church towards the poor. We will devote special attention to his major encyclicals, The Joy of the Gospel and Care for Creation.
