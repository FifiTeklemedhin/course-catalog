         This course is an intensive introduction to phonological theory and experimental work in phonology. This includes rule-based and constraint-based approaches, the typology of phonological processes (vowel and consonant harmony, assimilation and dissimilation, lenition and fortition, etc.), and phonological acquisition. Experimental approaches will deal with gradience, exceptionality, and productivity with an introduction to the quantitative methodologies that these phenomena require.
