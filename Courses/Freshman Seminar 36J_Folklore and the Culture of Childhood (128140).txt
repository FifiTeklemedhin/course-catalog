This course begins by examining the stories of Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen and explores the migration of fairy tales into literary and cinematic cultures for adults and for children. From fairy tales we turn to fantasy literature and to the great counterfactuals in Other Worlds constructed for children. Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and Neil Gaiman's Ocean at the End of the Lane will guide us through our investigation of what Graham Greene called the "excitement and revelation" of books read in childhood.
