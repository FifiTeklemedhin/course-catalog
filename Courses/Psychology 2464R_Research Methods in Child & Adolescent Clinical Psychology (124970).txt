This course is designed to give you exposure to the concepts, as well as the nuts and bolts, of research in clinical psychology of childhood and adolescence. There is a special emphasis in this course (as in the lab) on intervention research addressing youth depression, anxiety, and conduct-related problems and disorders. If you are a psychology concentrator at Harvard, you may have already taken classroom-based courses covering theories and methods that guide research in clinical psychology, such as Abnormal Psychology and Developmental Psychopathology. You may also have taken courses that introduced you to the types of statistical analyses (Psych 1900) and research methods (Psych 1901) used in psychological research. In this course, we will build on the foundation you received in such courses by applying what you have learned to the conduct of specific research projects.
In this class, you will participate in several aspects of the clinical research process via your active involvement in the research of our psychology laboratory. More specifically, through attending weekly class/lab meetings and participating in one or more research projects, you will learn how specific research ideas take shape; how research questions and hypotheses are generated; how studies are designed to address these research questions and hypotheses; how data are collected, cleaned, entered into study datasets, then analyzed; and how findings are interpreted and organized for presentation at professional meetings and in scientific publications.
The main goals of research in our lab are to build an understanding of which interventions for child and adolescent mental health problems are effective, and to promote use of the best evidence-based assessment and intervention in everyday clinical practice for youths and families. In pursuing these goals, we and our colleagues develop ways of structuring evidence-based practices to make them user-friendly and tailored to the settings in which youngsters typically receive mental health care—e.g., community mental health clinics and schools. Much of our work focuses on developing and testing these tailored approaches. We also conduct meta-analyses of the youth psychotherapy research literature, to sum up what has been learned from all the treatment studies with children and adolescents.
This course is designed to be useful to students who plan to pursue a career in child and adolescent mental health, particularly those with an interest in psychological research. However, the skills conveyed (e.g., critical thinking, research design, science writing) may be useful in a variety of ways and relevant to a number of different career paths.
Students planning to take the course should e-mail Gabriela Hungerford at ghungerford@fas.harvard.edu to schedule a phone call to discuss course objectives and requirements.
An interview with the instructors is required.
