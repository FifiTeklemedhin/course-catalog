         Music and Politics in the 20th and 21st Centuries. We will examine some basic questions, such as: what do music and politics have to do with each other? What are the means by which aesthetic products can be seen to relate to events, institutions, and ideological programs? How broadly can and should the "political" be construed? How has music been employed for political purposes during the twentieth century, and into the twenty-first? What roles has music played in protest movements? How do the political associations given to music change over time? We will look at musical works as well as text sources (journalism, letters, manifestos, etc.), and will think about media theory and theories of politics. One of the large issues that will accompany us through the entire seminar is how or even whether political (or indeed any other) meaning can be observed in music, and where that meaning resides.
Student projects may focus on any kind of music from anywhere in the world today or on historical music. Course Notes: Open to undergraduates with permission of instructor.
