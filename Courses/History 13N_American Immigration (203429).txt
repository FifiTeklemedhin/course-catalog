 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         Immigration has emerged as one of the most vexing and stubborn political debates in America today. Through readings and discussions of key works spanning the American immigrant experience since the late-nineteenth century, this seminar introduces students to the main themes and debates surrounding American immigration: the catalysts of migration and return migration, xenophobia, race, assimilation, labor, as well as the legislative history of border-making and immigration control. The seminar will finish with an analysis of immigration today, looking to the ways in which an understanding of the history of immigration might help shape how we think about current policies.
