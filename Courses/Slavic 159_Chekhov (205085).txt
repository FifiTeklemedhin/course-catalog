         This course explores how Chekhov revolutionized the short story while simultaneously laying the foundations for modern drama. Reading his four major plays and a wide selection from his prose, we trace the arc of his career, looking closely at his aesthetic innovations, moral psychology, and philosophical perspective. Finally, we probe the relationship between the prose and drama by working together to dramatize his stories. Students will write, produce, and/or act in a final collective performance, thus retracing for ourselves Chekhov's steps in moving between art forms and inventing a new kind of psychological theater. All readings are in English translation.
Course Notes: For students able to read in Russian, additional texts and discussions will be made available.
Additional Course Attributes:
Students will be required to attend occasional one-hour discussion sections where they will work in groups.
