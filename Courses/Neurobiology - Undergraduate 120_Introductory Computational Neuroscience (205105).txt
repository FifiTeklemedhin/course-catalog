This course introduces students to abstract models of what and how neurons compute and concrete analyses of real neurons in action. Topics include network models of sensory processing and memory, and techniques to compare these models with real experimental data. This course will emphasize students' contributions and classroom interactions. Programming projects will be a significant aspect of the course, so programming experience (Python, Matlab) is recommended. Familiarity—but not expertise—with linear algebra and differential equations will be assumed.
