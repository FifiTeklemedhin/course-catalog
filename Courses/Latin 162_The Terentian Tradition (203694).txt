         In this course, we will read a comedy of Terence (Eunuchus) and examine the literary conventions before moving on to later reworkings of Terentian comedy. Particular emphasis will be placed on the tenth-century abbess Rotsvita of Gandersheim (Dulcitius and Paphnutius) and her reimagining of the genre. How does she transform the classical comedy into a text of Christian edification? We will also pay attention to the intricate play with gender identity, as discussed in recent scholarship. For the final part of the course, we will take a quick look at humanist Christian reception of Terence (with selections from Gnapheus, Macropedius, and Schonaeus), and spend some time with Houghton's collection of Terentian manuscripts and incunables.
