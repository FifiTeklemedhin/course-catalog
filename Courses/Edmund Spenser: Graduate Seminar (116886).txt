       An introduction to Spenser's poetry, concentrating on The Faerie Queene. We will examine questions concerning the theory of allegory, the nature of romance, the place of thinking in poetry, and the tension in Spenser's work, present, because of him, in almost all subsequent English poetry, between personal expression, social structure, and cosmic order.
