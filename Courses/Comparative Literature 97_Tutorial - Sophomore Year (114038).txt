How to make a sound demonstration in the field of literary analysis? What are the building blocks for a cogent approach to comparative studies? We'll pay attention to various scales of textual commentary, from the microscopic lens of close reading to the medium scope of thematic reading, with an eye to macroscopic trends in literary history and critical theory. We'll befriend texts ranging from various genres (poetry; fiction; drama) and relate form to content, historical context to contemporary significance, and join the dots connecting notions of authorship to reception theory.
