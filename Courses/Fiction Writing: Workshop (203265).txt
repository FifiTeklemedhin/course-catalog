Fiction Writing: Workshop (203265)
Laura van den Berg
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0100 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
This course will serve as an introduction to the fundamentals of writing fiction. The initial weeks will focus on assigned readings—you can expect to encounter works by Edward P. Jones, Helen Oyeyemi, Joy Williams, Yoko Ogawa, and others—and short exercises. The readings will give us a lens through which to explore character, structure, time, point of view, etc, and will inform the workshop dialogues that follow. Later in the term, your own fiction will serve as the primary text as the focus shifts to the creation and revision of original work.
Course Notes: Admission based on submitted samples of writing. For information on specific application requirements, please see the English Department's
