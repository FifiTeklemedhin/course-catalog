           This is a course in linguistic anthropology. We explore key theoretical issues in the semiotic anthropology of language use, focusing on communication, social (inter)action, representation, cultural conceptualization, and language ideology. By presenting many of the most influential and innovative contributions to the study of language in culture and society—both recent and classic—the course aims to guide students in asking fundamental questions about language and communication more broadly as facts of everyday sociocultural experience.
Course Notes: No previous knowledge of linguistics or of anthropology is required. This course may fulfill the Entry Course requirement for Social Anthropology.
