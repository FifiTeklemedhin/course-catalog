Elementary Czech I (111301)
Veronika Tuckerova
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Part one of a two part introductory course in modern Czech language and culture, designed for students without previous knowledge who would like to speak Czech or use the language for reading and research. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Students are exposed to Czech culture through work with film and literature and gain some familiarity with the major differences between literary and spoken Czech as they learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research. Czech AA: Elementary Czech I (in the fall) and Czech AB: Elementary Czech II (in the spring) satisfy the foreign language requirement and prepare students for continued study of Czech in intermediate-level courses and for study or travel abroad in the Czech Republic.
Course Notes:
Part one of a two-part series. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in Czech AA in the fall and Czech AB in the spring within the same academic year.
This course will also meet for an additional hour of speaking practice to be arranged the first week of classes.
