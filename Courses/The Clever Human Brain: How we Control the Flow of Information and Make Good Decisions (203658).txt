Vital to any intelligent system is the ability to extract useful information from our surroundings and use it to make good judgements and decisions. What clever tricks does our brain use to accomplish this task? In this seminar we will have an in-depth examination of how our brain gates the flow of information with attentional control, how it encodes and stores goal-directed information in working memory, and how it encodes values, resolves conflicts and makes good decisions.
