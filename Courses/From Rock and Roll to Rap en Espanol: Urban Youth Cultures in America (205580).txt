From Rock and Roll to Rap en Espanol: Urban Youth Cultures in America (205580)
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
This course explores the history of race relations, civil rights, and youth cultures post WWII through the lens of music history. Although overtime, African American contributions to American Music have become more and more recognized (though still not enough especially in terms of Rock &Roll), Latino contributions to popular music in the United States have mostly been relegated to the margins of a narrative dominated by an overly black and white view of musical history. Latin music is often portrayed as an exotic resource for "American" musicians, as suggested by pianist Jelly Roll Morton's reference to "the Latin Tinge." Often seen as purely foreign music, this course turns that perspective on its head. We will document the roles of U.S. Latino musicians as interpreters of Latin American genres, as well as their roles as innovators within genres normally considered non-Latino music: R&B, jazz, Rock &Roll, country/western, punk and hip hop. For example, while African-American artists moved into niches in the music market where a modified urban sensibility still prevailed- funk, disco, soul, and pop; Puerto Ricans created their own labels and markets in New York for a mainland Spanish-speaking salsa following large enough to fill Yankee Stadium in 1973. In the course that follows, we examine how the sensibility and musical creativity of urban youth, in very different historical periods, inspired musical revolutions which transformed the tastes of entire generations, crossing boundaries of race, gender, nation and social class. Of course, we end with hip hop, reggaeton and their global implications.
