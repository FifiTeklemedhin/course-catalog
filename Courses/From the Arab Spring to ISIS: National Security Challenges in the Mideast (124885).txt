The Middle East is home to many diverse peoples, with ancient and proud cultures, in varying stages of political and socio-economic development, often times in conflict. Now in a state of historic flux, the Arab Spring and subsequent regional tumult have transformed the Middle Eastern landscape, with great consequences for the national security strategies of the countries of the region. The primary source of the world's energy resources, the Middle East remains the locus of the terror-WMD-fundamentalist nexus, which poses a significant threat to regional and international security, as does the rise of ISIS. The course surveys the national security challenges facing the region's primary players (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan, and Turkey) and how the recent upheaval has affected them. Unlike many Middle East courses, which focus on US policy in the region, the course concentrates on the regional players' perceptions of the threats and opportunities they face and on the strategies they have adopted to deal with them. Students play the role of senior advisers to the actual regional leaders in power and write "real world" policy papers for them, from their perspective and given the strategic, political and personal constraints they face. The course provides an essential vantage point for all those interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the region, especially those with an interest in "real world" international relations and national security.
