       This course explores the intimate relationship between literature, maps, diagrams, and related visual material in the early modern period. It asks about the emergence of new cartographies, maps, and itineraries in a period of increased interest in world travels, "discoveries," philology, and translation. How does the production of European maps relate to non-European cartographies? How can the "spatial turn" and the visualization of knowledge, key to digital humanities today, help deepen our understanding of early modernity? We will discuss European, Arab, and Chinese maps and texts such as Columbus&rsquo; Voyages, Aztec poems, WaldseemuÌˆller's and Ringmann's Universalis Cosmographia, Fracastoro's Syphilis, Ibn Battuta's Travels, Garcilaso's Royal Commentaries and Florida, Marguerite de Navarre's Heptameron, Montaigne's selected Essays, and Sor Juana's Divino Narciso.
