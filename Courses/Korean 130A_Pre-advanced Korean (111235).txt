         Korean 130a is designed for students who have completed Intermediate Korean 120b or have equivalent proficiency. Students will consolidate previously learned grammatical patterns and vocabulary through written and audio-visual materials on a variety of topics. By exploring the these topics in Korean, students will not only enhance their language skills of listening, reading, speaking and writing in Korean, but will also allow them to better comprehend Korean culture and society. Emphasis will be placed on developing abilities to present opinions and elaborate ideas through discussions and writings. Moreover, Chinese characters will be added in this course with the purpose of expanding vocabulary to the advanced level.
