understanding social norms, norms that get articulated through the witch's very violation of them. In this seminar, we ask what discourses about witches tell us about the societies that produce them. We begin by examining anthropologists' depictions of witchcraft among people who come to find magic believable: how do we understand the seemingly irrational idea that magic is real? Closely considering evidence from classic ethnographic accounts, we critically examine other scholars' answers to questions such as this one by thinking across competing approaches to the study of magic. Next, we analyze the film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and the television sitcom Bewitched, bringing these pop-cultural phenomena into conversation with Mary Douglas's treatise on Purity and Danger and Pierre Bourdieu's critique of Masculine Domination. These theories help us examine, for example, how fictional representations of witches speak to political struggles over class and gender. For the research paper, each student chooses an example of witchcraft on which to conduct independent research. Sample topics include fairy tales, the Salem witch trials, neo- paganism, and the Broadway musical Wicked. What will unite our diverse inquiries is a common interest in the social significance of this seemingly marginal figure: the witch.

therefore, like power." When Susan Sontag wrote these words, only journalists, artists, and tourists took photographs on a daily basis. Today our networked devices go everywhere our bodies go, and we are accustomed to taking and sharing pictures of ourselves and others throughout the day. In an age of Instagram and Facebook, perhaps it's time to revisit the nature of photography's power. In this course we will explore the documentary status of photographic images, and in particular, the way in which they communicate both knowledge and power. Certain questions will guide us: what kind of truth or reality can a photograph reveal? How might that same image distort reality? Is it right to photograph the powerless? Throughout the course we will pay particular attention to the collaboration -- and competition –between the photographic image and the written word. In the first two units we will center our discussion and writing on a series of photographic essays from LIFE magazine in order to understand how photojournalism shaped Americans' understanding of themselves and others in the 20th century. In Unit 1 we will look at a photo-essay from 1965, which describes –and makes visible -- the anxieties of a first-year student at Yale and the cut-throat world of the Ivy League university fifty years ago. In Unit 2, we will turn to LIFE's series on segregation and race in 1950s Alabama. Combining photographs and interviews, these ground-breaking articles conveyed the perspective of the segregationists -- and that of their victims. Your understanding of documentary photography and reporting after these two units will prepare you for the final unit in which you will conduct research and write a multi- source essay on a documentary film of your choice.
