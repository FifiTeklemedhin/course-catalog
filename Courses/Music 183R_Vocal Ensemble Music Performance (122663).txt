         Vocal Ensemble Music Performance: 1400 - 1600. A practical course exploring the rich repertoire of vocal chamber music composed in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, including French and Spanish songs, Italian madrigals, and sacred polyphony from across Europe. Students will prepare performances from original sources and write a short research paper. All works will be performed one person to a part. Although aimed primarily at singers, the class may also admit a small number of instrumentalists interested in playing medieval fiddle, single-row harp, or plectrum lute. Instruments may be loaned as needed.
