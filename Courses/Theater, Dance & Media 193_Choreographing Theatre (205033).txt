This course explores the syntheses of choreographic and directorial practices in theater making through the creation of an original work of performance. The devised work will function as a means of investigating the ways that heightened attention to movement draws out unique aspects of texts, which cannot be approached via Realism or Naturalism. The content of the performance will be derived from an array of sources ranging from literature, to documentary film, to critical writings, to daily conversation.
The research component of the course will entail a detailed investigation of the avant-garde Theatre movement in post World War II America. This is a movement in American theatre spawned from visual art, post-modern dance and avant-garde music more than from any prior theatrical tradition. The course will combine theory and practice, as students will integrate historical research into the content of their performance piece.
