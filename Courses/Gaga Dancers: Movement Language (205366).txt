Gaga—the movement language created by Ohad Naharin, artistic director and choreographer of Batsheva Dance Company in Israel—is a continuous, sensation-based movement class. Students are encouraged to interpret and
experience the somatic practice of listening to the body while activating a total sensorial attention. Gaga offers a creative framework for students to engage with physicality and imagination, bridging the activity between body and mind while increasing physical potential. There are no mirrors in Gaga, and there are no observers. GAGA Dancers is an advanced movement class in physical practice. Students should have previous dance training to enroll in the course.
