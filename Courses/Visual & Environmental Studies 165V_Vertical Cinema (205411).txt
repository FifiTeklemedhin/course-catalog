The ever-increasing flexibility of video presentation technology creates the opportunity to reconsider cinema's most deeply rooted conventions. In this course, students will create vertical videos. Drawing on a history of artists who have investigated aspect ratio, portraiture and the creation of new contexts for moving image, we will pursue a phenomenology of format through the creation of 9:16 work. The course will culminate in the erection of a temporary cinema house dedicated to vertical videos.
Class Notes: The first meeting of this class on Tuesday, January 23 will be in the 2nd floor sculpture studio of the Carpenter Center.
