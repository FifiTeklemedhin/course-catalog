Freshman Seminar 30O
What is College and What is It For? (121171)
Paul Barreira
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0300 PM - 0459 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 8
In the fall of 2012, more than 20 million students enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities. Who are these students, and why do they go to college? What are they seeking? This seminar asks students to think and write critically about higher education, considering, in Clark Kerr's famous phrase, "the uses of the university," from a variety of perspectives: historical, sociological, economic and developmental. As they do so, the seminar will address the questions that have faced students, administrators and public legislatures for over three centuries: What constitutes a liberal arts education? What are its goals? How should students be assessed? What role does extracurricular life, such as sports and fraternities and sororities, play in a college education? Does a college degree certify a vocational education, an intellectual one or a moral one?
