         Often heralded as the antidote to religious conflict, "secularism" has come under attack in recent years by scholars across the political spectrum. This course explores these recent debates as they have taken shape in the wake of the collapse of the "secularization thesis" –a once-dominant theory asserting the declining importance of religion in the modern world –in academic disciplines since the Cold War. Our goal will be to explore the relation of religion to democratic thought and practice by reading both recent critics and defenders of secular modernity in the fields of history, philosophy, and anthropology, and political theory. While the course will focus on Europe and the United States, it will also seek to understand how the legacies of colonialism and globalization have shaped the face of religion and the secular today. Two central questions of the course will be: Is secularism dead as a political program? If so, what ought to replace it? This is a junior tutorial.
