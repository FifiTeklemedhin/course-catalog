Geese migrate and sticklebacks school. Termites build air-conditioned castles and bees geometrically precise hives. What properties of the individual allow emergence of such ornate and coordinated activities from the group?

Which elements are innate and which learned during development? And do these "primitive" social behaviors speak to how humans behave, in groups or one-on-one? Are there specific genes that control social behavior throughout evolution, and, if so, are they conserved in humans and responsible for altruism, aggression, love, and loneliness? Does their perturbation give rise to disorders such as autism or schizophrenia? This seminar will explore such questions of social behavior, beginning with an appreciation for the variety of approaches that have found success in evolution. We will discuss, and visit labs using, new scientific tools that permit dissection of complex social interactions into underlying motifs exhibited by individuals, in order to find how these are controlled by specific genes and what brain circuits are responsible. We will discuss both classical and new discoveries. Expectations are class participation, and writing one paper (max. 15 pages) and leading a brief (10 minute) class discussion on one specific social behavior in an animal, with musings on how it might apply to humans.
