How can you convey insights from political science to a wider audience? In this course, we explore how to use both analytical and narrative techniques to animate an important topic; to convey a scientific finding; or to express a considered opinion. To this end, we discuss the core components of excellent political writing and workshop ideas and drafts for op-eds, long-form narratives, policy analyses as well as works of data and explainer journalism by members of the class. Readings include Jamelle Bouie, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jeffrey Goldberg, Jill Lepore, George Orwell, Anne-Marie Slaughter, E. H. Smith, and David Foster Wallace.
