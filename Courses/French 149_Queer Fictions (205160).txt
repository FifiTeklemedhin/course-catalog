Annabel Kim
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
A survey of modern and contemporary queer writing from twentieth- and twenty-first-century French literature. We will read writers such as Jean Genet, Hervé Guibert, Édouard Louis, Mireille Best, Violette Leduc, Monique Wittig, Anne Garréta. We will begin first with an introduction to some canonical texts in queer theory (e.g. Sedgwick, Butler, Bersani, Warner) and proceed to the fictions to see the ways in which literature itself theorizes, in addition to doing the work of deconstructing identity and desire.
