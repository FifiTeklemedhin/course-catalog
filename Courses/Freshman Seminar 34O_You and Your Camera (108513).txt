Although 2-dimensional images of the 3-dimensional world have been created for well over 30,000 years, up until the 19th century the skills for making these pictures were limited to relatively few people. Photography has changed this. Some estimates assert that there are now of the order of 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) pictures taken each year. You might ask yourselves why people take all these pictures. Another question you might ask is what characterizes a good picture. More to the point how do the pictures that each of us take compare with those of famous photographers.The seminar will start with a historical review of art and photography in order to develop appreciation for both, the various reasons that we want images and the hallmarks of the best images. Certainly the art of taking good pictures can be empirically learned without understanding the technical aspects of photography. On the other hand, the seminar will discuss aspects of the scientific basis behind the empirical practices in the hope

that this will enhance your flexibility in applying the practices. Topics to be covered include both the physical optics of simple and compound lenses as well as the quantum physics that is the basis of the electronic devices that are fundamental to digital photography. The differences between the RAW, JPEG and TIFF methods for storing digital photographs will be discussed along with artifacts that can arise in the digitization of images. One issue that arises in color photography is the manner in which the human visual system transforms the wavelength information in the light entering the eye into perceptions of color. The seminar will explain the trichromatic theory of color vision and then discuss the color management systems for display and printing. Finally, the seminar will discuss methods for editing pictures. Software that may be discussed include the open source (free) GIMP and RawTherapee and/or Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.

Arrangements for loaned cameras will be made for those that do not own one.
Ideally students should have a good high school physics course; however, individuals who are motivated to understand the science of photography should not have a problem with the material taught in the seminar. Similarly students should feel comfortable with high school algebra and trigonometry.
