W 0830 AM - 1129 AM 12
This course explores research methods and techniques through the analyses of emerging energy-efficient materials and systems and their applications in buildings. It serves as an interdisciplinary platform for engineers, materials and computer scientists to interact with the design students and develop new products. The course introduces ideas-to-innovation processes in a hands-on, project/product focused manner that balance engineering concepts with promising, real-world opportunities. Switching back and forth between guided discovery and focused development, between bottom-up and top-down thinking, and market analyses, the course helps students establish generalizable frameworks as researchers and innovators with a focus on new and emerging technologies.
Course Notes: Offered jointly with the Design School as SCI 6477.
