          What are theater and dance? What is at stake when a performance is live or recorded? How do performers use space, time, and bodies to make meaning? What is the relationship between a performance and a script? Why do performers and audiences gravitate to live arts? How do economic and political circumstances shape live performances? This sophomore tutorial in Theater, Dance &Media provides students with an intellectual and practical foundation to the concentration by exploring these questions and more. Readings will include theoretical texts from Schechner, Phelan, and Chaudhuri, alongside scripts and other performance materials by Kennedy, Bausch, Kaprow, and Smith. Assessments emphasize how to write about performance and how performance serves as a form of criticism.
