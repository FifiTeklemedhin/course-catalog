T 0100 PM - 0359 PM 12
This workshop introduces the television pilot with a focus on prestige drama and serialized comedy. Students will excavate their own voice and explore the structure and execution of pilot writing through a first draft of their own original script. With intensive reading and discussion of student work we will examine elements of TV writing, such as treatments and outlines as well as character, dialogue, tone, plot, and, most importantly, vision. Over the semester, we'll turn ideas into worlds and worlds into scripts.
Course Notes: Admission based on submitted samples of writing. For information on specific application requirements, please see the English Department's
