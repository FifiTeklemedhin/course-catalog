         Remember that episode of "Master of None" where Aziz and his friends are discussing how men and women experience the world in different ways? Have you overheard similar conversations but felt like you were out of your depth? Then this is the course for you! Male/Female, Man/Woman, Masculine/Feminine, Straight/Gay. Where do these consequential categories come from? How do they generate inequalities? Why are they so easily reproduced? And what, if anything, should we do about it? Combining real-world applications with academic analyses, this course encourages students to think about how sexuality and gender have shaped the social world, as well as their own place within it. (Public Service Announcement: Contrary to popular belief, heterosexual men are indeed welcome and encouraged to take this course.)
