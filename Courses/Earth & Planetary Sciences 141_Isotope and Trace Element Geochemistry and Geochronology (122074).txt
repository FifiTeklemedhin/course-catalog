Stein Jacobsen
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The origin of the element and isotope distribution in the Earth and the Solar System. Closed system radioactive decay, isotope fractionation, mass balance and mixing. Application of Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, Lu-Hf, Re-Os and K- Ar isotope systems for geochronology and as tracers for geological processes. Noble gas geochemistry. Extinct nuclides. Cosmogenic nuclides. U-Th-series nuclides. Planetary isotopic evolution. Stable isotope geochemistry. Application of H, C, N, O, and S isotopes as tracers of geochemical and biogeochemical processes.
