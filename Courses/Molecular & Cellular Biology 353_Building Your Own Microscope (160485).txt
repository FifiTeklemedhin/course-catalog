         Microscopes of various sorts are used by most biologists, who typically buy these off the shelf. With a little knowledge, however, most biologists can build their own microscopes to do many of the things that the commercial ones do. In this quarter course, you will learn to build an epifluorescence microscope and to acquire images using a computer.
