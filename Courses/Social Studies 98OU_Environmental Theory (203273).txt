         The term "anthropocene" –which suggests that the natural world has been profoundly altered by human activity – originated in the physical sciences and has become an increasingly popular a way to describe the time in which we live. But how have the social sciences understood nature and humanity's relationship to it? Is this relationship best framed in terms of human exceptionality and domination? Is our connection to the natural world and its non-human inhabitants best construed, alternatively, in terms of interdependence or, perhaps, ethical obligation? What are the social, political, and economic implications of the relationship between nature and humanity? This course will explore these and related concerns by pairing classic texts from the history of social and political thought with contemporary ecological discourse. This is a junior tutorial.
