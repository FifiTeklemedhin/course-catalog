Entrepreneurship--the formation and growth of new firms--is a complex phenomenon that has historically attracted relatively little academic attention. In recent years, however, scholars in a variety of disciplines have been devoting increasing attention to this topic. This course explores the emerging work in this dynamic area. Reflecting the complex nature of entrepreneurship, the course will touch on literature in a variety of academic disciplines. The 2015-16 class focuses on works from the industrial economics, organizational economics, economic geography, macroeconomics and sociology literatures; the 2017-18 class focuses on works from the corporate finance and labor literatures. Students taking the course for credit will be expected to complete three referee reports and a paper. This course is cross listed as HBS 4351.
