This course explores musical forms, both small- and large-scale, across a variety of genres and periods. Students will be introduced to issues and approaches to analysis of form, as well as the history of these practices. We will delve into questions of formal function in addition to examining modern theoretical and analytical engagement with this broad and multifaceted topic. Topics of focus will cover forms in the Western Music Canon but also explore structures in Jazz, Popular Music, Folk Musics of the world, and Musical Theatre.
