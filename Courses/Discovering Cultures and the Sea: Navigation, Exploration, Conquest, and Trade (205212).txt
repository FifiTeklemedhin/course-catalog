Theodore Bestor
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Oceans separate distant places, but throughout history societies have looked across the seas for ways to make faraway connections. This seminar will examine many ways that cultures around the world have been shaped by maritime matters. Navigation, Vikings and Basques in North America, the spice trade, Spanish galleons, slavery, New England's clipper trade with Asia, Maine lobstermen, naval warfare, and contemporary overfishing are all parts of the story. Two short essays and a term project (approximately 12 pages), as well as in-class individual and group presentations.
