         This course will provide an introduction to Latinx literatures and cultures in the United States from 1960 to the present, paying close attention to the historical and social events that have influenced the construction of U.S. Latinx identities as a field within American Studies. Through the examination of canonical texts produced in English, Spanish and Spanglish we will analyze questions of racial, ethnic, sexual, and cultural identities in conversation with current theoretical concepts such as Diaspora, border identities, code-switching, triple-consciousness, intersectionality. While our focus is on Latinidad as a U.S. concept, we will also explore its expansion as a political and cultural term in Latinx diasporas in Madrid, Milan, and Amsterdam.
Course Notes: Course is in English, with optional section in Spanish.
