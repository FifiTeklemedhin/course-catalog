         Every cell is a part of a larger "community", working together to enable tissue function. This course will explore the principles of building complex tissues from cells. How do cells know what tissues to make and when to make them? How do cells communicate with one another? What diseases can arise when these principles go awry? How can we build tissues in the lab? In addition to lectures, students will engage deeply in primary literature.
