Blue collar and middle class, Blacks and Latinx, Christians and Muslims, Americans and French, Harvardians and Yalies â€“groups have, by their very definition, some criteria to discern those who belong from those who do not,
whether they are as large as whole nations, or as small as a group of friends. But what does it mean for a group to have a collective identity? This course will examine what collective identity is and how we can study it sociologically. It will ask questions such as Does a collective identity rely on group members sharing the same past experiences, or does it rely on them facing similar present circumstances? To what extent do group members have to agree on what their collective identity is, and how are disagreement and conflicts managed? How do group members engage in identity politics, and how do they compare their groups to others?
The course will begin with a review of sociological literature that addresses some of the key debates on this topic. Moving forward, students will design and complete their own research projects. Each student will choose a group in the Boston area or on campus, formulate a research question, and conduct participant observations and / or interviews. The course will cover the various steps of the research process, from formulating a research question through collecting and analyzing data and reviewing existing literature, to constructing the final paper.
