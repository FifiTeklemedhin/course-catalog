         From its foundation in 1909 through WWII, futurism developed into the first international cultural-political avant- garde. Its aim was the revolutionary transformation of all spheres of life and its influence extended from Europe to the Americas to Asia. The seminar adopts a cross-disciplinary and comparative focus; and includes such topics as humans and machines; experimental poetics; futurism's ties to anarchism, bolshevism and fascism. Media surveyed include poetry, performance, music, painting, photography, radio, and film.
