         This research seminar will use an evolutionary and biocultural framework to examine the history and differentiation of human populations. We will explore how ecological pressures and other evolutionary forces have shaped biological and behavioral variation within and between human groups, and will consider (and in some cases question) the adaptive significance of such diversity. We will also reflect on how culture can influence our understanding of human biology, and discuss how studies of different aspects of human variation, such as 'race', have and continue to impact society.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the junior research seminar requirement for HEB concentrators.
