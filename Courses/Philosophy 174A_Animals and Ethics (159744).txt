 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
           Do human beings have moral obligations to the other animals? If so, what are they, and why? Should or could non- human animals have legal rights? Should we treat wild and domestic animals differently? Do human beings have the right to eat the other animals, raise them for that purpose on factory farms, use them in experiments, display them in zoos and circuses, make them race or fight for our entertainment, make them work for us, and keep them as pets? We will examine the work of utilitarian, Kantian, and Aristotelian philosophers, and others who have tried to answer these questions.
Course Notes: This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Ethical Reasoning.
