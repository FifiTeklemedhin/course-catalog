         Human's capacity to self-reflect is incredibly adaptive â€“it allows us to plan for the future, deliberately control our behavior, evaluate ourselves, introspect, and take others' perspectives. But, self-reflection has a dark side as well that underlies depression, anxiety, rumination, and egotism. This course examines how self-reflective biases such as self-preoccupation, self-interest, and egocentrism contribute to feeling superior about one's point of view, being unwilling to recognize that one's opinions may be incorrect, behaving in ways that are selfishly inconsiderate and antisocial, and having emotional overreactions to trivial transgressions. In addition, this class examines how these negative consequences can be reduced through a "quiet ego," a way of living characterized by less self-reflection, self-focus, and self-centeredness. Empathy, altruism, morality, humility, self-compassion, flow, mindfulness, authenticity, and forgiveness will be examined.
