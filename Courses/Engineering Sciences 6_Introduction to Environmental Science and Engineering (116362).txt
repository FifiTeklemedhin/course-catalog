 This course will provide students with an introduction to current topics in environmental science and engineering by providing: an overview of current environmental issues, critically evaluating their underlying science and knowledge limitations, and exploring the best-available engineering solutions to some of our most pressing environmental problems. The course will emphasize the interconnected biological, geological, and chemical cycles of the earth system (biogeochemical cycles) and how human activity affects these natural cycles within each of the major environmental compartments (atmospheric, aquatic, and terrestrial).
Course Notes: This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.
Recommended Prep: The course presumes basic knowledge in chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the high school level.
