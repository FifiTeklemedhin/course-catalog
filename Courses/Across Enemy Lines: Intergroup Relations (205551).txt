Across Enemy Lines: Intergroup Relations (205551)
Prerana Bharadwaj
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 20
How do social groups come to a state of conflict or war? And how do they recover afterwards? Understanding group conflict and resolution requires examination of the social psychological dynamics that push people apart, and bring them together. This course uses social psychological research on intergroup relations to attempt to understand global and domestic group conflicts using such concepts as group identity, prejudice, and collective emotions. Group conflict resolution strategies such as contact, dialogue, and apologies will also be evaluated.
