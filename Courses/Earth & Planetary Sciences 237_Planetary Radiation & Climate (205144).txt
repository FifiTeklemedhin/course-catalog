         Atmospheric radiative transfer, including stellar properties, spectroscopy, gray and real gas calculations, Mie theory and scattering, satellite retrievals, and radiative-convective climate modelling. Climate feedbacks: the runaway greenhouse, volatile cycles on Mars and Titan, and atmospheric collapse around M-stars. Atmospheric evolution and escape (Jeans, diffusion-limited, hydrodynamic), and key processes in planetary atmospheric chemistry.
Course Notes: EPS 237 is also offered as Engineering Sciences 237. Students may not take both for credit.
