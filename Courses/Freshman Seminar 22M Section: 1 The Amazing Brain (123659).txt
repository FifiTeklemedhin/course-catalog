Freshman Seminar 22M Section: 1 The Amazing Brain (123659)
John Dowling
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
Clinical cases have told us much about human brain function. This seminar will examine some of the famous neurological cases, what we have learned from them, and explore brain mechanisms. Included will be Broca's patient "Tan" whose case led to the identification of one of the brain's language areas; Phineas Gage, whose injury to a specific brain region changed his personality dramatically; and patient HM, who after brain surgery, no longer could remember things for more than a few minutes. We will expand on the cases by reading from my book Creating Mind which is an introduction to brain and mind mechanisms in language accessible to anyone who has had elementary high school science. Many of the chapters describe other medical cases, not as well-known as the classic cases described above, but instructive nevertheless.
Course Notes: I especially invite those students who are not planning to concentrate in neurobiology or a natural science to join the seminar.
