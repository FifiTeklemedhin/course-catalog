Aristotle's Heirs: Greek and Roman Culture in Christianity and Islam (205218)
Julian Yolles
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Who owns the Greeks and Romans? For centuries, civilizations in regions as diverse as Iraq and Iberia, northern Europe and North Africa, have laid claim to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Ancient Greece and Rome. Christians and Muslims in Baghdad, Palermo, and Toledo translated philosophical, scientific, and literary works into Arabic and Latin. Why did they devote so much time and money to studying and teaching Plato, Aristotle, and Vergil? This freshman seminar follows the story of how ancient Greek and Roman thought was transmitted and transformed in the Christian and Muslim intellectual traditions. Students will read seminal works by Plato, Augustine, al-Farabi, and Dante, and engage critically with modern depictions of the recovery of ancient thought in literature (Borges) and film (The Name of the Rose).
Course Notes: All readings are in translation. The course will include required visits to the Harvard University Art Museums and to Houghton Library.
