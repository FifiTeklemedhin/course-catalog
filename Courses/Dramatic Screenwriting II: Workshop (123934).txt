       We'll examine films and screenplays in order to develop the skills necessary to write the first draft of a feature- length script. We'll begin by honing our treatments and outlines, and move on to critiquing specific scenes in our own work and in produced screenplays, with a rigorous focus on character, dialogue, tone, structure, plot, and voice.
