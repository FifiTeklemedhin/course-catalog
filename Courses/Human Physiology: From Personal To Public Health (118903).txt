The course introduces students to the functioning of the human body in health and disease. Students will examine determinants of their own health (genetics, diet, environment, sleep, exercise, stress, social interactions) and consider how these and other factors impact the health of diverse communities around the world. Emphasis will be placed on how the human body responds to physiologic challenges, such as psychological stress and environmental exposures, and on topics with high public health impact (obesity, smoking, mental health and addiction). Activities include lectures, 2 guided laboratories/demonstrations, structured weekly sections that focus on scientific literacy, and a directed term project.
