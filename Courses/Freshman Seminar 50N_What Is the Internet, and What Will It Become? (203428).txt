         The internet has become a central part of our everyday life, a conduit for commerce, and part of the connecting tissue of our social networks— from email to the World Wide Web to the way we get entertainment, run video-
conferences, shop, or find information. But what, exactly, is the Internet? Who runs it, how did it happen, and what is its future? How does it change our way of finding information, of working, or of seeing the world? What are the trends, in technology, policy, and law that will form the internet and, by extension, or lives going forward? This seminar will look at all these questions, and some others. We will start by looking at the history of the internet— how it happened, what design choices informed its construction, and how the various standards that define this network of networks were decided, adopted, and enforced. We will then look at various controversies that center on the current internet, including issues like who should govern it, what influence national laws should have on this seemingly borderless entity, and the role of encryption in communication, security, and privacy. We will then turn to some possible futures, and the implications of these futures on the way we live our networked lives. Will the internet change the way we work? The way we vote? The way we think? This course does not pre-suppose any knowledge of how the internet works or how it is governed. While there will be some discussion of the technical aspects of networking, computer hardware, and computer software, all that will be needed to understand the issues will be presented as part of the seminar.
