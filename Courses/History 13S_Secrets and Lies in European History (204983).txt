         How should one distinguish what is "true" or "real" from what is "false" or "fake"? What is the difference between concealing the truth (secrecy) and lying? Is falsehood ever justifiable? These questions are newly important but not novel. This course will draw on "case histories" that lie at the source of some of Europe's most infamous economic and political scandals, examining themes such as forgery, sensationalism, conspiracy, espionage and false evidence. While studying falsehood and fakery, the course will endeavor to teach students to be "true" to their sources: to conduct research, build an evidentiary base, and make verifiable arguments.
