 In his seminal work from 1945, How to Solve It, George Polya introduced principles of mathematical problem solving that are widely applicable to problems in science and engineering. This year-long class focuses on building a powerful and portable problem-solving and modeling tool kit while bridging the divide between mathematics and science courses. The second semester will be organized around projects in areas of student interest. Both Math ESPA and Math ESPB must be taken in the same academic year to receive credit.
