The Existence of God: Arguments and Refusals (205630)

2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap:
T 0200 PM - 0359 PM 30
This introduction to Christian theology will ask why some Christian writers have crafted arguments for the existence of God while others have not. Who do these arguments hope to persuade? Under what conditions are they designed to work, and to what practical end? Conversely, what does it mean when a Christian author refuses the use of such arguments? After reading historical examples from authors including Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Calvin, Descartes, Kant, and Weil, we will contrast these sources with contemporary discourses in which the existence of God (or not) is often treated as the decisive feature of warring "worldviews."
