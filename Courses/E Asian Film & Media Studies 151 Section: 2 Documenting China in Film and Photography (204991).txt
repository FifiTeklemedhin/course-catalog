How have cameras borne witness to modern Chinese history and contemporary China's transformations? In this course, we will analyze documentary photography and cinema taken in China from the early 20th century to the present day, through the lenses of both Chinese and foreigners. We will interrogate the visual "evidence" that camera images can offer, look into their production and reception histories, as well as discuss the ethics, aesthetics, and politics of representation. Although we will give special focus to major historical events such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Cultural Revolution, and the 1989 Tiananmen protests, we will also examine visual documents of contemporary Chinese society such as migrant labor, demolitions, the One Child Policy, and environmental issues. Audiovisual texts will be complemented by theoretical and contextual readings, and the final project for the course will be writing a proposal for a documentary project of one's own.
