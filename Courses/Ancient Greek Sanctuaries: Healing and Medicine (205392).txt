         How was disease understood and healing sought in ancient Greek religion? What was the relationship of religious healing to the practice of medicine in Mediterranean antiquity? What light does this history shed on contemporary ideologies and practices of health care? Exploring three prominent sanctuaries of the physician-god Asklepios that were sites of pilgimage and religious healing (Epidauros, Kos, and Pergamon), the seminar will consider a range of archaeological and literary evidence. Enrollment limited to 15 with the permission of the instructor, by application at the first course meeting.
