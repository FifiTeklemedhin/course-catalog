This studio class will introduce students to the use of oil paints as a tool for image making, with an emphasis on process over product. Assignments will morph and evolve, one building on another, while drawing on a variety of source materials. Expanded visual acuity and an openness to experimentation will be developed as students explore the nature of oil paint and how it can be used to transform experience into art.
