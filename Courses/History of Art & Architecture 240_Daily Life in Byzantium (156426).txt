The course will focus on the private and public life and world of everyday Byzantine society. Although most of the surviving material evidence originates from court and religious environments, the course will attempt to study Byzantine society as a whole. Course topics will examine the private as well as public life of the individual from childhood to adult life through artifacts from the household, work and other social environments. Emphasis will be on the early and middle Byzantine periods (5th â€“12th c.).
