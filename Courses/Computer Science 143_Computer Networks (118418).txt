         Computer networking has enabled the emergence of mobile and cloud computing, creating one of the most important technological breakthroughs in computing of the past decade. We expect two major paradigm shifts will take place in the next ten years. First, we will witness the emergence of 5G wireless mobile networks, which will begin to replace the current 4G networks as early as 2020. Second, blockchain technology, which has powered Bitcoin, is creating a new trusted network infrastructure that will allow information to be distributed but not copied. In order to play a role in this era of network-based computing, students must have a thorough understanding of these emerging networking technologies and applications. Beyond teaching the basic networking protocols, which have become very mature and can be treated as a black box, in CS 143, we will teach new networking issues and topics of significance. This focus on upcoming wireless and blockchain advancements is the motivation for CS 143 this semester. The class will be organized into the following eight modules: (1) A view of the future: 5G and blockchain; (2) Basic networking concepts: network interoperability, decentralization, security, and robustness; (3) Radio basics: Wave propagation physics; (4) Wireless networking protocols: Wi-Fi, MAC protocols; (5) New 5G technologies: Millimeter wave, Ultra Dense Networks (UDNs), MIMO; (6) Fundamentals of blockchains: Peer-to-peer networking, distributed database, cryptography-driven consensus protocols; (7) Blockchain in mobile networks: trust economy, smart contract, blockchain-as-a-service; (8) Machine learning assisted networking: Data-driven network protocols. Students in the course will read and discuss basic material as well as the latest literature, gain hands-on experience through a programming assignment, and have the opportunity to present the concepts and insights learned through a final project.
Prerequisites: CS50 (or programming experience) and a strong interest in the subject matter. Lab sessions will be provided to give extra support.
