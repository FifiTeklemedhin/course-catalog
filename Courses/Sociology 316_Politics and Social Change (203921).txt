The Politics and Social Change Workshop promotes the development of a community of scholars interested in how power relations shape social patterns in societies around the world. We define 'politics' broadly to include everything from gender politics within the household to state politics within a transnational system. Our participants' interests span a wide range of topics including political sociology, political economy, political violence, political behavior, governance, democracy, state welfare, education, social movements, civil society, NGOs, protest, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, the media, the environment, and development, among others. We meet twice a week. During most meetings, group participants take turns discussing their works in progress. Once or twice a semester, we also bring in outside speakers to discuss topics of interest to our members.
Class Notes: Co-taught with Professor Peggy Levitt, Wellesley University/Weatherhead Center
