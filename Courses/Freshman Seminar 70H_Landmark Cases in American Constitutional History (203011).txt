         This freshman seminar will cover landmark Supreme Court decisions in American history: Marbury v. Madison (1803) (origins of judicial review); Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) (racial segregation in railroad transportation); Korematsu v. United States (1944) (Japanese-American internment); Brown v. Board of Education (1954) (school segregation); Brown II (1955) (Brown's remedial order); Engel v. Vitale (1962) (school prayer); Reynolds v. Sims (1964) (legislative malapportionment); Miranda v. Arizona (1966) (right against self-incrimination); Furman v. Georgia (1972) (death penalty); Roe v. Wade (1973) (abortion); Bakke v. Board of Regents (1978) (affirmative action); and Obergefell v.

a couple of related cases. The seminar's aim is to elucidate how the Supreme Court functions as a political institution—that is, to see how the Court's decisions reflect the broader social and political context, and to consider the consequences of its rulings. The readings aim to present enough different angles from which to view the Court's rulings to enable discussion of how a particular issue—such as the death penalty—became a topic of social controversy and of constitutional law, why Justices' opinions were written as they were, and an evaluation of the decision's reasoning and its consequences. Readings for each session will average about two hours. In addition to discussing the readings, students will be required to write three papers reacting to the readings, each of about four or five pages. Students will be afforded some degree of choice in the weeks for which they write papers.
