         To provide clinical insight and critical analysis of basic and translational science approaches necessary for students to approach psychiatric disorders as scientific problems, and thus contribute future research work with clinical relevance. Each pair of lectures presents 1) basic neuroscience approaches to the neural circuitry, cell and molecular biology underlying disease, followed by 2) clinical neuroscience, genetics, neuroimaging, etc., including case studies of the disorders.
The lectures will focus on a range of psychiatric disorders, neural systems underlying behavior, and translational approaches to novel interventions, while providing insight on disease characteristics, current, novel and translationally-informed treatments, gene vs. environmental risk factors, animal models, and gaps in knowledge across the field. There will also be laboratory-based sessions (organized visits to McLean Hospital) to demonstrate examples of basic and human laboratory approaches to the study and treatment of psychiatric illness.
