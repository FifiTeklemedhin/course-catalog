         The mission of the course is to impart students with a strong intuition for designing quantitative assays and performing data analysis in biology. The course will extract general principles through a set of lectures and workshops, focusing on some of the major techniques used in biology today. We will discuss the physicochemical basis of major measurement techniques in biology, and we will explore how this basis leads to particular errors, and what types of statistical pitfalls might be encountered in data analysis.
Recommended Prep: Knowledge of programming, statistics, physics and chemistry. Additional Course Attributes:
