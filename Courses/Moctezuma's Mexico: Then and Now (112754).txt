DaviÃÅd L. Carrasco William Fash
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0100 PM - 0159 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Explorations of the mythical and social origins, glory days and political collapse of the Aztec Empire and Maya civilizations followed by study of the sexual, religious and racial interactions of the ``Great Encounter'' between Mesoamerica and Europe. Focus on the archaeology, cosmovision, human sacrifice, divine kingship, the mystery of 2012 and rebellion in Mesoamerican cities and in colonialism. Hands-on work with objects at the Peabody Museum aid in examining new concepts of race, nation and the persistence of Moctezuma's Mexico in Latino identities in the Mexico-US Borderlands.
