         This seminar examines crime and criminalization across the life course. Social processes and context are emphasized. Key themes include the long-term study of continuity and change; trajectories, transitions, and turning points; cohort effects; and social change (e.g., mass incarceration, the crime drop). Both qualitative and quantitative approaches are covered, highlighting research on crime, inequality, and contextual change. A major portion of the seminar will be devoted to the development of student projects.
