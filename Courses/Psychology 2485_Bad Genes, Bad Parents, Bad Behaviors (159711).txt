          This class will explore the biology of criminal behavior and violence. We will examine the construct of "anti-sociality" and unpack clinical and diagnostic issues surrounding its diverse manifestations, such as psychopathy. A strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms. A particular focus will be on understanding how genes and environments act and interact to predispose antisocial behavior by shaping brain function and development.
