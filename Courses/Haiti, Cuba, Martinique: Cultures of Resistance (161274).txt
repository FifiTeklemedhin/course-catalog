           What makes a novel moving, a film disturbing? How does humor work, even in the grimmest context? "Haiti, Cuba, Martinique" explores these aesthetic questions in works that engage slavery and its legacies, resistance and revolution, and paths to "development." We will consider historical context and discuss categories like "genre" fiction, didactic writing, realism, romanticism, and la littérature engagée, or "committed" literature. Includes works by Alejo Carpentier, Césaire, Chamoiseau, Condé, Cortázar, Gutiérrez Alea, and Lahens.
Course Notes: Taught in English. For concentration and secondary credit in Romance Languages and Literatures, readings and written work must be done in
