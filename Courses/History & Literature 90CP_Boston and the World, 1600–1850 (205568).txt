         This course studies Boston's early history and literary culture. Our readings will feature prominent and influential authors such as John Winthrop, Anne Bradstreet, Samuel Adams, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Our class activities and assignments will involve travel around Cambridge and Boston to explore sites, museums, and archives. Throughout this course we will seek to understand how the Boston area's distinct local culture has been shaped by global migration and exchange, from transatlantic Puritanism and Native American trade to the slave trade and Irish immigration.
