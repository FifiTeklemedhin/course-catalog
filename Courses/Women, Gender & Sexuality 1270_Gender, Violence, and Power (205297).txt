Gender, Violence, and Power (205297)
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
This seminar will explore understandings of gender-based violence through the lenses of feminist and trauma theory. Topics include intimate partner violence, sexual assault, child abuse, workplace harassment, Title IX, and street harassment. We will examine the evolution across time of cultural and medico-legal understandings of the problem, important developments in policy, medicine, and law in the last 40 years, and how violence looks outside of the male-female binary through which it is often understood.
