2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 5
Description. Graduate seminar on strategies for designing, executing and analyzing experiments on large populations, as well as large collections of experiments. We will consider settings where units of analysis may be assigned treatment in multiple experiments, running concurrently. The course is largely based on critical reading of recent articles and technical reports, and on the instructor's own experience in designing complex field experiments, and in working with experimentation platforms at large IT companies.
