This class will introduce students to techniques used for research in the study of politics. Students will learn to think systematically about research design and causality, how data and theory fit together, and how to measure the quantities we care about. Students will learn a `toolbox' of methods---including statistical software---that enable them to execute their research plans. This class is highly recommended for those planning to write a senior thesis.
