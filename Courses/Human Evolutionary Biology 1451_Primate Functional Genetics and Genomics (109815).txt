Recent advances in genetics, genomics, and developmental biology are improving our understanding of human and non-human primate biological traits. These disciplines, when incorporated into a multi-faceted context, can reveal the mechanistic basis of evolutionary adaptations. This seminar is designed to investigate and critically evaluate foundational and novel research in primates (and other organisms) that employs the tools of these trades. In doing so, students are exposed to an integrative perspective upon which to explore classic and modern questions in functional biology.
