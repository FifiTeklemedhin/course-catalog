The Universe is not static, but rather stars and entire galaxies are evolving as revealed by their variability on timescales ranging from milliseconds for collapsed stars (neutron stars and black holes) to gigayears for stars and galaxies. In this seminar we shall explore stars and nuclei of galaxies through variability –from how brightness variability of stars with binary companions measured with small telescopes measures star masses and radii, to the extremes of variability of stars that undergo repeated huge flares, to enormously luminous variations from accretion onto gargantuan black holes in the nuclei of "Active Galaxies" (Blazars and Quasars). We shall use the Clay Telescope on the Science Center roof to make some repeated observations (from the 8th floor Astronomy Lab) of several types of variable stars and accretion-powered binaries and deduce what life would be like if either were our Sun. From a Blazar, we shall observe historical outbursts that occasionally change brightness to exceed its host galaxy by a factor of ~100, by using the digitized brightness measures on thousands of glass plate images taken by Harvard telescopes from 1885 –1992 and now digitized and on line from our Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH) project. The seminar will include readings from an introductory Astronomy text as well as both popular and journal articles and the short books Black Hole (Bartusiak) and Black Hole Blues (Levin). Students will use astronomical software to measure stellar brightness and variability from telescope images as well as learn temporal analysis techniques with applications to other disciplines. Students discuss in class readings and observations conducted and write short papers on their observations and deductions.
