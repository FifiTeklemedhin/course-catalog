case, those who hold power cling to it at all costs, while those who feel oppressed or excluded fight to attain some power of their own. In most societies, power is concentrated in the hands of a select few, and even in the world's democracies, many citizens continue to feel powerless—the playthings of some distant and shadowy elite, or of grand political and economic forces beyond their control. In this course, we will consider some of the fundamental questions regarding the nature of power: Does power always have to be "power-over," with one group dominating the rest? Or is it possible for groups of people to generate "power-with," empowering themselves to act in pursuit of shared goals? Is power ultimately synonymous with violence, or wealth, or political authority? Is it possible to exercise power over culture and ideas in addition to people and resources? As the course progresses, we will converse with the dissident writers who confronted the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, examine the student- led movements that toppled dictatorships in the 21st, and consider what these episodes can teach us about the techniques of domination and resistance in democratic societies like our own. To that end, we'll conclude the course by testing our theories of power against some recent and acclaimed documentaries, from films like Jehane Noujaim's The Square and Laura Poitras' Citizenfour, which give us front row seats to history-making acts of revolution and civil disobedience, to polemical works like Ava DuVernay's 13th and Craig Ferguson's Inside Job, which aim to expose the workings of power in relation to racial and economic inequality.

In most societies, power is concentrated in the hands of a select few, and even in the world's democracies, many citizens continue to feel powerless—the playthings of some distant and shadowy elite, or of grand political and economic forces beyond their control.

Or is it possible for groups of people to generate "power-with," empowering themselves to act in pursuit of shared goals? Is power ultimately synonymous with violence, or wealth, or political authority? Is it possible to exercise power over culture and ideas in addition to people and resources? We will approach these questions through the methodological lenses of political science, sociology, anthropology, and history, while also considering examples drawn from documentaries and current events. In our first unit, we will establish working theories of power-over and power-with, and consider their application to both democratic and non-democratic contexts. In the second unit, we will refine our concept of power-over, testing it against studies of power and resistance in Appalachian mining communities, Malaysian peasant villages, and American low-income urban schools. We'll also take an in-depth look at a headline-making study that claimed to prove that America is more oligarchy than democracy. In the final unit, we'll revisit the concept of power-with by exploring the strategies that social movements like the Civil Rights Movement use to develop and exercise power, and conduct further research into contemporary movements like the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter.
