The fictional world of "The Game of Thrones" is often associated with the Middle Ages. Why is this the case? What do our associations today tell us about the ways in which we appropriate history and narratives? In this course, we will use the popular fantasy show Game of Thrones to explore events, structures, and people in medieval history, art, and literature. Students will gain a reflective understanding of medieval culture, society, and religion while engaging in a critical discussion on medievalism.
