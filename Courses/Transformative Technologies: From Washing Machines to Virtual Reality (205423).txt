Transformative Technologies: From Washing Machines to Virtual Reality (205423)
Alma Steingart
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
This course examines the relationship between technology, culture, and politics in the United States since the end of the nineteenth century. How have technological changes shaped American society from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day? How, in turn, have technological innovations been impacted by cultural and social trends and contexts? This course, which serves as an introduction to the history of technology, is organized into three cross-cutting themes: (1) labor, (2) gender and identity, and (3) infrastructure. Within each unit, each week will be dedicated to a single technological artifact. By tracing the design, use, and effects of that technology, students will learn how to analyze the social, economic, and political factors that fashion and impact technological innovation. For their final projects, students will choose a technological artifact not included on the syllabus and apply the theories and methods learned throughout the semester in order to write a cultural history of that object.
