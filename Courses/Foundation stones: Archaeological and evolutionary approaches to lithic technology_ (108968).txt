Christian Tryon
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: T 1200 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 20
Stone tools represent the oldest known human technology. They represent the most abundant and arguably one of the most informative elements of the archaeological record for reconstructing ancient human behavior over the last 3.3 million years. In this graduate seminar that is open to undergraduates with permission, students are provided with a solid methodological and theoretical grounding in how to interpret stone (lithic) tools. The course includes hands-on training in how to make stone tools, a practical grounding in their identification, qualitative and quantitative approaches to their analysis, and detailed discussions of current theoretical perspectives that use stone tools to understand broader questions about the evolution and diversity of human behavioral adaptations. The course also provides a global synthesis of stone tool variation since their advent, drawing heavily on the analysis of archaeological collections from New World and Old World stored at Harvard's Peabody Museum, capped by student-devised experimental research projects.
