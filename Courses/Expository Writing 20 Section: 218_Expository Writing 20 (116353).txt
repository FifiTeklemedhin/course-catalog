Social Worlds of Friendship at
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Note: This Expos course requires participation in several activities scheduled outside of normal class hours.
Social science research has traditionally suggested that we tend to seek out friends who are similar to ourselves. But is this always true? What factors inspire people to venture outside of their comfort zones through friendship – especially at Harvard? In collaboration with the Learning Lab at Harvard's Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, this course explores the formation of social networks on our campus and investigates how meanings of identity and difference are constructed through the experience of friendship. In Unit 1, we examine Emerson's renowned essay, "Friendship" (1841), working with his handwritten manuscripts at the Houghton Library to search for clues that illuminate Emerson's often paradoxical thinking about the significance of friendship. We then carry forward the complexities of relationships that Emerson reveals into an interview-based research project that explores friendship and social life at Harvard. In Unit 2 we will read Harvard's important Report of the College Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion (2015) as well as theories of "social capital" (the networks and support systems that promote health and happiness) as we analyze the delicate interplay between the processes of how people "bridge" across boundaries of their identities, and how they "bond" within particular friendship groups. We will also explore how meanings of difference and belonging play out across specific contexts of the College (e.g., Annenberg, blocking, extracurriculars, and student organizations). In small teams, students will design individual research projects through proposals that involve both writing and on-camera speaking at the Bok Center's Learning Lab. In the third unit, students will carry out their individual research in close connection with their teams. Towards the end of the semester, we will publicly share our research findings through a class capstone project. For this class, students should be interested in working on visual presentations as well as written papers. This course is hands-on and heavily collaborative, modeling that which it studies –namely, a spirit of engagement, dialogue, and community.
