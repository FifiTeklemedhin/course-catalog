For millennia the end of the world has been feared, imagined, and exorcized by gifted writers, religious leaders, and intellectuals from the most diverse cultural backgrounds. Scholars have even suggested that –over the last few decades –such a worldview centered around an imminent end has become hegemonic by appearing in an almost endless number of very popular media stretching from blockbuster movies to comic books. This seminar will explore the cultural reasons behind this paradoxical attraction of humans towards fantasies detailing the end of the known world in catastrophic and often terrorizing colors. Imaginations of the end seem to have begun with the birth of the "apocalypse" as a literary genre in ancient Judaism and Christianity. The seminar will follow some trajectories of these fantasies by comparing and contrasting exoteric ancient and medieval religious texts with modern and contemporary novels and movies. The ultimate goal will be to see how the rupture of social bonds, zombie or demonic attacks, and natural disasters are preferential occasions to reflect on the relationship of humans with nature, with the supernatural, and with each other. A few scholarly essays will be assigned, but the largest part of the course will be occupied by the direct reading, viewing, and discussion of primary materials (with the final opportunity to write your own tale of "the end of the world").
