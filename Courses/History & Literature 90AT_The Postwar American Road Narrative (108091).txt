 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         This course examines a vibrant subgenre of post-World War II American literature. We will read major novels by Kerouac, Nabokov, and Didion as well as less familiar (yet still fascinating) writings by Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, Patricia Highsmith, Ralph Ellison, and others. In addition, students can expect to analyze both primary and secondary historical sources, while giving some attention to visual art (e.g. John Chamberlain) and to film (e.g. Bonnie and Clyde).
