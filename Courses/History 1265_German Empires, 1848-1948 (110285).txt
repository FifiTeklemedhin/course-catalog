         This course examines the history of Germans in Europe and elsewhere, starting with the revolutions of 1848 and ending with the separation of Austria, West Germany, and East Germany following the Second World War. We will consider multiple different visions of what ``Germany'' should be, what borders it should have, and who should be considered ``German.''
Course Notes:
This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Societies of the World. This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past. This course is also offered through the German Department as German 143. Credit may be earned for either German 143 or History 1265, but not both.
