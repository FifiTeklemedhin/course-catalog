Entrepreneurial activity has been a potent source of innovation and job generation in the global economy. In the U.S., the majority of new jobs are generated by new entrepreneurial firms. Entrepreneurship has had many definitions over the past two and one half centuries since Richard Cantillon first used the term in the early 18th century. Some have focused on the risk-bearing nature of entrepreneurship, while others have focused on the innovations that entrepreneurs create. Both are important elements of what entrepreneurs do, but neither is a complete definition of entrepreneurship. This seminar will examine the role that entrepreneurship and venture capital plays in economic development and innovation. Academics and policy makers have long highlighted the critical role that these sectors play in promoting a dynamic economy and opportunities for sustained competitive advantage. In particular, venture capitalists have been the source of financing for most of the major technology leaders including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amgen, and Facebook. Numerous countries have sought to grow their domestic venture capital industry. This seminar will explore the phenomenon through the lenses of economics, history, and psychology. Entrepreneurial and venture capital markets in the US, Israel, and China will be examined in depth through academic articles, books, and Harvard Business School case studies. In addition to traditional class sessions, the seminar will incorporate field trips to the Harvard Innovation Lab and startup companies.
