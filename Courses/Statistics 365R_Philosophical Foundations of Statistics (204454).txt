Statistics 317 is also offered as Computer Science 282r. Students may not take both for credit.
Students will be expected to be comfortable with distributions and inference at the level of something like CS281. Practically: Can you derive and implement Bayesian linear regression for a modestly-sized data set? A Gibbs sampler for a mixture model? An importance sampler for a given distribution?
