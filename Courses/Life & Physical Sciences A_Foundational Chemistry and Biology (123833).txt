MWF 0900 AM - 0959 AM n/a
with any two of the following courses: Life and Physical Sciences A, Life Sciences 1a, Physical Sciences 1, Physical Sciences 10, or Physical Sciences 11. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe. NOTE: Physical Sciences 1 and Physical Sciences 11 cannot both be taken for credit.
A strong background in chemistry. Students are expected to have had Honors or AP-level high school chemistry preparation or a placement score of 650 or better on the Harvard Chemistry Placement exam. A few operations of calculus are developed and used. Fluency in pre-calculus secondary school mathematics is assumed.

             This course introduces fundamental concepts in chemistry and biology. Topics in chemistry include stoichiometry, acids and bases, aqueous solutions, gases, thermochemistry, electrons in atoms, and chemical bonding. The course also examines biological molecules, the transfer of information from DNA to RNA to protein, and cell structure and signaling.
Course Notes:
Requirements:
Students should use their scores on the Chemistry and Biology Placement Tests to determine whether to enroll in Life and Physical Sciences A or Life Sciences 1a. This course assumes fluency with high school algebra. Students who have completed Life Sciences 1a, Physical Sciences 1, Physical Sciences 10, Physical Sciences 11, Chemistry 17 or Chemistry 20 may not take Life and Physical Sciences A for credit. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education Requirement for Science of Living Systems.
Anti-req: Cannot be taken for credit if Life Sciences 1a, OR Physical Sciences 1, OR Physical Sciences 10, OR Physical Sciences 11, OR Chemistry 17 OR Chemistry 20 already complete
