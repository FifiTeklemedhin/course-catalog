Much of our history is written in our genes, and analyses of ancient and modern DNA have revealed that many living humans retain a genetic signature from our extinct evolutionary cousins, the Neanderthals. In this course, we will work together to help you find your inner Neanderthal. Our understanding of the past begins as you learn to make your own stone tools, a unique window to interpret the Paleolithic record. This experience guides your examination and analysis of real artifacts made and used by Neanderthals >50,000 years ago, drawn from the extensive collections of Harvard's Peabody Museum. The ability to create and interpret the archaeological record provides unparalleled insight to explore what the Neanderthals did and thought, and how they lived, loved, and died in Ice Age Eurasia. In addition to artifact manufacture, analysis, and weekly readings, there will be a field trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to examine how Neanderthals and other early humans are represented in public displays of the past, and the course will culminate in the student design of a museum exhibit to be displayed on the Harvard campus. This freshman seminar will draw on perspectives from archaeology, paleontology, the history of science, and museum studies to study the Paleolithic, will provide the ability to think critically about how we interpret the past, and will explore how a study of our extinct relatives reveals the biases inherent in our perceptions of the world around us.
