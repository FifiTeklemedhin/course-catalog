Physics 123 is the same course as Physics 223; if you are a graduate student, please enroll in 223. Limited to 20 students. Physics 123 is also offered as Engineering Sciences 153. Students may not take both for credit. Undergraduate engineering students should enroll in Engineering Sciences 153. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.
