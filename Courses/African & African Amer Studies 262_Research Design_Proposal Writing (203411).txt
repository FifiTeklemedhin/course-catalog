This course is a practicum designed to help students craft effective research and grant proposals, learn how to constructively critique others' proposals, and develop enduring collaborative relationships. Many writing problems are fundamentally thinking and design problems. For this reason, conceptual structure, project design, and methodological choices will occupy a great deal of our time. The first half of the semester will focus on Wenner- Gren-type proposals, the second half on proposals for the National Science Foundation and similar funders.
