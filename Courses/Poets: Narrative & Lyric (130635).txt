This course is a general introduction to reading, discussing and writing about poetry. Our theme this year will be Nature Poetry –that is, poems written about natural environments and humans' precarious place within them. We begin with Milton's epic, Paradise Lost, and then turn to eighteenth-century satires by Pope &Swift, and work by the Romantics—Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Barbauld, Keats, Shelley, Clare &Charlotte Smith. Other writers will include: Americans like Dickinson &Whitman; Modernists such as Eliot &Stevens; post-war poets including Bishop, Ammons &Walcott; as well as several contemporary poets such as Rae Armantrout &Monica Youn. By the end of the course you will be able to pick up any poem and think, talk and write cogently and creatively about it.
