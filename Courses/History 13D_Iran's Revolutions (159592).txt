 Iran witnessed two major revolutions in the twentieth century; the Constitutional Revolution in the first decade of the twentieth Century and the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Starting with the 1979 revolution, this seminar journeys back in time (and then to the present) to offer an overview of modern Iranian history. We will examine the major social, cultural, and political characteristics of the 1979 Revolution in relation to the history of Iran in the twentieth century and from a comparative perspective between the two revolutionary moments. We will then return to the present by examining the nature of the state and society that has resulted from the 1979 revolution.
