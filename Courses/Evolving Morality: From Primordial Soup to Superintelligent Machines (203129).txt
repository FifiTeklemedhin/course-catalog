2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 200
This course examines the evolution of morality on Earth, from its origins in the biology of unthinking cooperative organisms, through the psychology of intelligent cooperative primates, and into a future inhabited by machines that may be more intelligent and better organized than humans. We begin with foundational scientific questions: What is morality? Where does it come from, and what does it do? How is it implemented in our brains? We then apply our scientific understanding of morality to foundational moral and political questions: How should human societies be organized? How should we resolve the moral questions that divide us? Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by increasingly powerful artificial intelligence. Can machines (such as self-driving cars and military "drones") be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can we adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children?
