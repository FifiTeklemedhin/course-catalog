Raquel Vega-Duran
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course will explore the evolution of cultural, historical, and political relations between Spain and Latin America, starting with Christopher Columbus's diary of his first trip to the "New World" and finishing with stories about Latin American immigrants in Spain today. We'll study literary and political texts, chronicles, maps, paintings, photographs, personal letters, manuscripts, and films in order to understand the Atlantic as a space of both connection and separation from 1492 to the present. We will study works from Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, and others.
