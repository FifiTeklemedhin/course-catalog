       Recent research on religion has stressed social-science approaches. Parts of the work assess effects of economic and other forces on religious participation and beliefs. This topic includes models of secularization and of competition among alternative forms of religion, including analyses of the Reformation. Religious conversion and the club model of religious participation will be considered. Other aspects of the research analyze effects of religiosity on microeconomic variables, including work effort, thrift, education, health, and violence. Parts consider the impact of religion on macroeconomic outcomes, including economic growth. Additional work considers the interplay between religion and political institutions, including the role of state religion and interactions with Communism and democracy.
