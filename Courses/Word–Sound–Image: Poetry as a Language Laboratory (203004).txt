literature. We will discuss visual poetry from Ancient Greece and Renaissance England, poems about paintings by Rilke and Auden, avant-garde texts and performances of Futurist and Dadaist artists, postwar French sound poetry, international concrete poetry movement, contemporary artists' books, as well as recordings and readings of major poets. We will look for poetry in Harvard Art Museums and listen to recordings in the Woodberry Poetry Room. We will examine artists' books from Harvard libraries, attend a poetry reading in Cambridge, view electronic archives of poetry, analyze voices of poets performing their texts, and study poems which are barely legible. We will confront these poetic experiments with scholarly texts from such disciplines as sound studies, art history, acoustic phonetics, graphic design, and literary studies. Finally, we will ask what are the gains and challenges of using innovative techniques and technologies in poetry and art.
