         What's the right carbon price? What can whale oil and horse manure teach us today? What's the role of solar geoengineering? The course has two goals: to provide a set of tools to approach these and many other fundamental climate policy questions, and to help us distinguish positive ("what will be") from normative ("what should be") analysis. Economics and political economy provide particularly powerful lenses through which to analyze climate policy—past, present, and future.
