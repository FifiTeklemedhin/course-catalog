The representation theory of simple Lie groups is best described in terms of subgroups of quantum SU(2). Higher representation theory is constructed analogously from SU(n). We present higher analogs of matrices, roots, weights, Dynkin diagrams, representations, Young diagrams, etc. The quantum SU(2) representations are used in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theory. Higher representations appear to give insight into 3+1 dimensions.
