             The sequencing of the human genome has ushered in a new era of scientific investigation. In parallel, advances in molecular biology have made it possible to explore the processes underlying normal development and disease pathogenesis. We will apply principles and techniques of molecular biology - ranging from DNA structure to the Central Dogma, from PCR to cutting-edge genome-editing technology - to understand how genetics and genomics inform gene regulation and cell identity and, ultimately, the human condition.
Recommended Prep: Life and Physical Sciences A or Life Sciences 1a; Life Sciences 1b (or equivalent) or permission of the instructor.
