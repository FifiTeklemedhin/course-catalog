         This seminar is an introduction to international law and international organizations for students of international relations. Why do states conclude treaties and establish international organizations - and what determines their institutional design? When and how do international institutions promote cooperation between states? What is their effect on domestic politics? We survey recent international relations scholarship on these and similar questions and conduct case studies in the security, economic, and environmental policy areas.
Class Notes: Undergraduate seminar. Enrollment by lottery. Please see Gov Dept undergraduate website for details.
