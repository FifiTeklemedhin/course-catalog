 Graduate Course
         For many graduate students, teaching will be part of their career, whether as mentoring, formal classroom teaching, or outreach. In addition, the theory and research evidence accumulating in the disciplines of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and from STEM classrooms, has turned the question of, 'How do we best teach science?' into its own scientific discipline. The Theory and Science of Teaching focuses on understanding why certain teaching methods are effective by examining the scientific research and theoretical frameworks that support these methods. We will read and discuss foundational educational and cognitive psychology texts and primary literature, and then develop an annotated lesson plans that allows us to put these ideas into practice.
