         Is the moral and intellectual weakness of some races and social classes inscribed in their skulls and faces? Is crime a natural phenomenon for which there is no cure? Are some crimes truly "savage"; some behaviors literally "beastly"? In a world dominated by unstable power relationships shaped by colonialism and social inequity, discussions about the meanings of race, heredity and crime often intermingled in troubling yet politically potent ways. In particular, with the rise of Darwinism in the 1860s, more and more people looked to the authority of nature to argue for the political necessity of controlling reproduction (so-called eugenics) through policies ranging from involuntary incarceration, forced castration and sterilization and, in the case of National Socialist Germany, medicalized murder of the "unfit." In the course, we will explore the roots of all these policies, beginning in the late 18th-century. We will end by asking: have the tragic lessons from this dark period in the history of science been learnt? A final section will be devoted to the periodic resurgence of efforts to appeal to the authority of nature to explain complex social and historical phenomena, from difference in scores on intelligence tests to the use of science to dictate social norms.
