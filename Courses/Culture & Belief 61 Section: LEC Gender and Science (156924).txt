 Culture and Belief
           Why are women well represented in some fields of scientific study but not others? Do gender beliefs influence the content of scientific knowledge? How is gender encoded in the practices and norms of science? This course explores the intersection of gender and science from Bacon's seventeenth century call to raise a "masculine" science to the present. Topics include: girls, boys, and science education; gender and technology; women in the science professions; bias and objectivity in science; and gender and science in literature, film, and popular culture.
