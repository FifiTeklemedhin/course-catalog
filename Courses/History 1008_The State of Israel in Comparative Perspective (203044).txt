TR 1000 AM - 1129 AM n/a
This course addresses controversies surrounding the history of Zionism and the state of Israel. Central to these controversies are questions of comparison. Is Zionism a movement for collective liberation, like national movements of stateless or colonized peoples, or a variety of western colonialism? Does Israeli statecraft operate within a normal geopolitical spectrum, or is it unusually expansionist and aggressive? This course seeks to answer such questions through a broad and deep analysis that spans the 19th and 20th centuries, pays close attention to Israel's social and cultural history as well as high politics and military affairs, and imbeds modern Israel into multiple global contexts.
