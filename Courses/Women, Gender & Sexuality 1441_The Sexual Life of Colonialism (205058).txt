         Sexuality has long shaped racial and civilizational assessments of what it means to be modern. We will investigate the role of colonialism in racial imaginations of gender and sexuality and how these histories shape contemporary understandings of queer politics, rights, and resistance around the world. We will explore histories of sexual control, colonial and racial difference, and marginal sexualities in colonial and postcolonial spaces, including West Asia, South Asia, and Sub-saharan Africa. The course will cover many forms of sexuality including interracial relationships between colonizer populations and the colonized, questions of sexual violence, queer and same-sex desires, sexual outcasts like prostitutes, and the politics of gender difference and trans individuals.
