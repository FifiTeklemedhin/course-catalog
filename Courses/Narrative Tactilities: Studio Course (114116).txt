 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
         In this intermediate production course, we will explore systems, syntaxes, and voices of cinematic fictions across national cinemas in the 20th and 21st century. We will investigate all aspects of the mise-en-sceÌ€ne through exercises in screenwriting, directing professional and amateur actors, storyboarding, lighting, sound design, art direction, and digital editing. Students will also research and develop short scripts to be produced during the spring term. Occasional in-class workshops by film professionals and artists.
