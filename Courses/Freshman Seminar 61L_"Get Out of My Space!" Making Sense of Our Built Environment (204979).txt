But architecture has another much more important function: It helps us imagine other possible ways of living. Architecture helps us envision the spaces we want to live in. In this seminar, we will explore the different ways in which we have created, claimed, fought over, shared and continue to imagine space. Our discussions will put a premium on the way architects, artists and social actors have produced space, and how their ideas and projects guide the way we understand our constructions of space. We will make space through hands-on projects such as mapping social networks and transforming your space through the technique of collage. These projects will challenge and help you record, transform and produce space. This seminar is designed to enrich your knowledge of space so that you may take a position on
