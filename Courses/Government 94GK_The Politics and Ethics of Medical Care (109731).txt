This course is an introduction to medical ethics and the ways in which political theory can inform our understanding of the moral and political dimensions of medical care. Using case studies as a launching point, we will explore ideas about autonomy, paternalism, beneficence, and distributive justice, and their application to issues such as informed consent, euthanasia, the right to refuse care, the distribution of scarce resources, and conflicts between patient rights and the public good.
