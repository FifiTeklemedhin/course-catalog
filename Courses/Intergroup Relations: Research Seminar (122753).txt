Students meet on a weekly basis to discuss ongoing research on psychological mechanisms involved in power, stereotyping, inequality, identity, and ideology. Undergraduates will work under the supervision of a graduate student in the design and conduct of lab- based and survey experiments, and the input, coding and early analysis of empirical data. Undergraduate enrollees will also attend biweekly critical discussions of research articles in the field, and will have the opportunity to develop and receive feedback on their own research ideas.
