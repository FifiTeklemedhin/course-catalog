Since the arrival of Africans from Africa to America, their health and health care has been a critical issue for the nation. From the era of slavery to the present, African Americans have been disproportionately burdened by disease and ill health. Health disparities are the "inequalities that occur in the provision of healthcare and access to healthcare across different racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups." This course examines this issue over the long time frame from the 17th century to the present. Currently, compared to the white population, African Americans are at an overall greater risk for many serious and life threatening diseases. This course will examine how these disparities emerged over time. It will explore the strategies and practices that African Americans employed to improve their health care. It will also examine, the ways that cities, states and the federal government supported or ignored the health of African Americans.
