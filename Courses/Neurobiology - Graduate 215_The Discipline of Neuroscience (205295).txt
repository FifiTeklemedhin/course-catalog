This course will endow students with the broad conceptual fluency in the discipline of neuroscience required to relate genes to circuit function, metabolism to neurological disease, and cell biology to neural computations. Through a combination of lectures and in-class activities, students will learn to design, quantitatively analyze, and interpret experiments that address a variety of questions spanning molecular to systems neuroscience. During the first semester, students will think critically about the fundamental units of the nervous system within the context of cellular function, electrical conduction, and chemical signaling. The second half of the course builds upon this foundation to focus on broadly defined "networks of neural function" as related to coordinated neural activity, the concerted execution of genetic programs, and anatomically defined structural networks. The course culminates with students writing a grant proposal in the style of the NIH NRSA.
