             Considers the construction and analysis of mathematical models that arise in the life sciences, ecology and environmental life science. Introduces mathematics that include multivariable calculus, differential equations in one or more variables, vectors, matrices, and linear and non-linear dynamical systems. Taught via examples from current literature (both good and bad).
Course Notes:
Recommended Prep: Additional Course Attributes:
This course is recommended over Math 21a for those planning to concentrate in the life sciences and ESPP. Can be taken with or without Mathematics 21a,b. Students with interests in the social sciences and economics might consider Mathematics 18. This course can be taken before or after Mathematics 18. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
A course in one variable calculus preferably at the level of Mathematics 1b.
