Stable isotope systems serve as one of our most powerful tools in reconstructing both Earth History and environmental/climatic change over nearly all timescales. These isotope systems are driven by basic physical chemical principles that if understood, allow even more to be drawn from core isotopic systems (namely the biogeochemical elements â€“C, H, N, O, S). Further, advances in mass spectrometry now allow for site-specific isotopic determinations, as well as the quantification of trace isotope bonding (clumping). This course will begin with a quick but rigorous review of the chemistry underpinning equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects, before moving to survey the systematics that govern the most popular low temperature isotope systems. From there, the bulk of the course will target new and emerging isotopic targets such as clumping in O2 and methane.
