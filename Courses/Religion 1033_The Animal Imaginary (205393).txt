          This course considers the history and meaning of fantastic beasts, holy animals, and magical creatures in religion, folklore, and mythology. In light of the past global abundance of animal species, and now in the face of their rapid, large-scale extinction, why have existing animals not been "enough" for the human imagination? Enrollment limited to 30 with the permission of the instructor, by application at the first course meeting.
