         This course surveys the history of Latin America from the 19th century until the present. Drawing on diverse scholarly materials, this course explores different independence movements across the region, processes of state- formation, and how social and racial hierarchies that emerged out of the region's colonial past continue to shape Latin American societies. We will examine the rise of populism, the history of the U.S. in Latin America, the politics and culture of the tumultuous 1960s, and struggles for democracy and citizenship. The course concludes with the experience of Latinos in the U.S. and Latin America's place in a globalized world.
