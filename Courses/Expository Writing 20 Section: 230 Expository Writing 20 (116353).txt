examples such as the Rwandan genocide (where the U.S. failed to intervene) and the Balkan Wars (where NATO did intervene). But other experts say that intervention just makes suffering worse. How do we understand this debate in a historical context? In the final unit, we will dig into several ongoing and highly contested issues in human rights, like the "right to be forgotten," which would force Google to erase certain unwelcome search results; the race-, religion-, and gender-infused debate over whether Muslim women should be allowed to wear headscarves in public spaces in France; Ta-Nehisi Coates's argument in The Atlantic for reparations to the descendants of black American slaves; the growing debates over transgender rights and restroom access; the role of the Nuremberg legacy in the success (or failure) of trying war crimes today; and even Harvard's own complicated relationship to slavery in the United States.

Tragedy and Everyday Life
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
The image of Oedipus blinding himself at the end of Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus is among the most violent in Western drama. Realizing that he has killed his father, married his mother, and brought a plague upon his people, Oedipus represents a human scenario too horrible to imagine. And yet Western culture does imagine it—it can't seem to stop imagining it—and the most horrible thing about the tragic fate of Oedipus is the suggestion that tragedy lurks within each of us as a fundamental risk of human existence. In this course we will examine tragedies both ancient and modern, asking why certain human scenarios are supposed to be tragic and whether those scenarios represent states of exception within the ordinary range of human experience—or exceptions that prove an unsettling rule. In Unit 1 we will read Sophocles' Antigone (442 BCE), examining the structure of tragic conflict and considering the manner in which this particular structure reflects the form of critical debate more generally. In Unit 2, we will compare

Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus (429 BCE) and Shakespeare's King Lear (1606), asking whether the criteria of self-knowledge that plague Oedipus remain stable after two millennia or present themselves in a new "modern" fashion. In Unit 3 we will view a selection of films, including Vertigo (1958), Persona (1966), Memento (2000), and Black Swan (2010), asking whether the tragedy of contemporary culture can be understood as an everyday and insoluble conflict between individuals, themselves, and the societies in which they live.

Human Rights as History
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
The U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights has thirty articles, among them the more familiar —"life, liberty, and security of person" —and the less familiar —the right to a family, to cultural life, to rest and leisure. We often presume that human rights need no justification or explanation. But what are human rights? Are they really universal? We begin our course by looking at the "strange triumph of human rights" in the aftermath of the violence of the Second World War. After analyzing the development of this idea over time, we'll think about how human rights are (or are not) protected. We'll draw on A Problem from Hell, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, who argues that powerful countries have a moral responsibility to prevent genocide. Power addresses examples such as the Rwandan genocide (where the U.S. failed to intervene) and the Balkan Wars (where NATO did intervene). But other experts say that intervention just makes suffering worse. How do we understand this debate in a historical context? In the final unit, we will dig into several ongoing and highly contested issues in human rights, like the "right to be forgotten," which would force Google to erase certain unwelcome search results; the race-, religion-, and gender-infused debate over whether Muslim women should be allowed to wear headscarves in public spaces in France; Ta-Nehisi Coates's argument in The Atlantic for reparations to the
