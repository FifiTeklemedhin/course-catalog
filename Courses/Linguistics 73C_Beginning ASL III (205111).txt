ASL III is designed for students who have completed ASL levels I and II. Students come to ASL III with an understanding of the fundamentals of ASL comprehension and production. These foundational courses (ASL I and II) introduce students to the language using a natural acquisition approach without explicit focus on grammatical rules. ASL III has an increased focus on the appropriate ways to converse with members the Deaf community. In this class, students will learn how to tell stories that adhere to the pragmatic and linguistic standards of the Deaf community with a focus on stylistically appropriate production. In this class, students will learn how to engage with members of the Deaf community in respectful and culturally appropriate ways. In addition to fostering language development, we will discuss the history and culture of the Deaf community.
