         The dearth of effective antibiotics for modern bacterial pathogens, and "superbugs" in particular, presents a crisis that has been likened to terrorism in its potential consequences to human society. The basis and context of the problem will be discussed in detail, with a special emphasis on the history of antibiotics discovery and development. We will explore the molecular properties of antibiotics, their bacterial targets, and the chemistry behind the inhibition and engagement of these targets. The evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms and strategies to overcome these through chemical innovations will be presented using specific case studies. We will focus on the role chemistry has played in the development of new antibiotics, the molecular evolutionary paths engineered by humans over decades to develop new, more effective drugs, and how modern chemistry might be used to discover and manufacture future medicines for the treatment of human infectious diseases.
Course Notes: Students are expected to have a good working knowledge of high school chemistry. A basic familiarity with chemical structures and their depictions is
desirable, but not required. There will be required visits to two state-of-the-
