This course examines the ways that an elusive population group called "The Celts" has been constructed from antiquity to the present. We study the linguistic, archaeological, genetic, mythological, literary and institutional bases of "Celticity" in the light of recent critiques of the ways in which these different kinds of evidence have been asked to walk hand in hand with one another in the service of certainty about Celtic identity. All texts are read in translation.
