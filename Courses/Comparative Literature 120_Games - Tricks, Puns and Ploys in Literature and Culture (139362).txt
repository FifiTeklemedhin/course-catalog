         This course is an exploration of games and their philosophical stakes for literature, film and music. Drawing from insights ranging from material culture to anthropology, we will reflect upon the ludic dimension inherent in literary composition. Our texts will cover the thematic approach to games (including chess, cards and dice novels in the Russian tradition with Dostoyevsky and Prokofiev) before moving to a more formalist take on game—building upon the idea of "play" in language and improvisation in aesthetic terms. We'll first explore how the shady trade of make- believe can be connected to the very notion of theatricality (Shakespeare, Corneille, Renoir). Then, we will see how film, theatre and music have reflected upon the gambler as a character (Prokofiev, Lang); finally, we'll see how experimental texts use chance processes as catalysts for their composition—looking at possibilities opened up by infinite variations for Queneau, a dice throw for Mallarmé, an I-Ching sequence for Philip K. Dick, and the tarot figures for Calvino. The comparison between genres, formats and intellectual traditions around the focus of game- playing in aesthetic terms is designed as an introduction to comparative literature, expanding its range into the study of material culture and anthropology. This course will feature regular screenings, guest lectures from the Music department and visits to the Peabody Museum and the Harvard Art Museums.
