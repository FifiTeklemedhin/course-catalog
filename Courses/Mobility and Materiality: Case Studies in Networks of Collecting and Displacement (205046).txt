Mobility and Materiality: Case Studies in Networks of Collecting and Displacement (205046)
Diana Sorensen
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course is built around the conjoined paradigms of circulation and thing theory. Students will select a case study to work on early in the semester, and together we will probe the ways in which material culture intersects with processes of cultural exchange. The case studies might involve the transplantation of objects as well as subjects across borders, calling into question established conceptions of national and regional boundaries.
