TR 1000 AM - 1129 AM n/a
The history of western art, like any story, has a plot (Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, etc.), protagonists (Michelangelo! Van Gogh! Pollock!), and a climax (Modern art). By looking backward instead of forward, beginning with contemporary works and ending in the Middle Ages, this course complicates the traditional narrative of progress, considering instead how the past continuously informs an ever-changing present. By including excluded stories while critiquing the very concept of narrative as it relates to art history and the survey, the course combines the canonical with the critical and serves an introduction to both the history of art and the discipline of art history itself.
