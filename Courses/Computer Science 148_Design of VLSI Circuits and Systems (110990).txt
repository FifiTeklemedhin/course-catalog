TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM 16
Preference given to upper-class undergraduates or graduate students in computer science or in business.
Programming experience (CS 50 should be fine) and interest in the subject matter. Importantly, CS 143 is NOT a prerequisite. Labs and extra support will provide intensive preparation in the first weeks of the semester to help students quickly obtain the networking background necessary to excel in the course.
