         Reinventing the self is a long-standing American tradition, but over the past century the focus of making over the self has increasingly been on the body. Reality TV shows, magazines, and personal testimonials celebrate the power of transforming the self through one's appearance. This course investigates the historical roots and contemporary manifestations of the makeover phenomenon with a focus on the race, class, and gender politics of bodily modifications. At the same time that we will be considering the cultural power of the "after" bodies in the before-and-after motif, we will be examining the meaning behind bodies that are considered "outlaw" in American culture---fat bodies, aging bodies, and bodies that subvert gender norms.
