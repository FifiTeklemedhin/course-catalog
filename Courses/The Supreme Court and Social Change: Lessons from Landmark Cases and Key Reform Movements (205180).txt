Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously wrote: "The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience." This seminar considers the idea of experience—including events external to legal doctrine—affecting the law. It discusses how social movements—groups of citizens mobilized in support of a cause—deploy the Constitution and other types of rights talk to "frame" disputes and move forward their agendas. Seminar participants will discuss how movements crystallize grievances, mobilize supporters, demobilize antagonists and attract bystander support by referencing constitutional rights and other ideas about law. It also considers the effectiveness of movements' legal strategies. The seminar considers these questions in relation to the abolitionist, woman suffrage, civil rights, women's rights, anti-poverty, same-sex marriage and Tea Party movements, among other recent reform efforts.
