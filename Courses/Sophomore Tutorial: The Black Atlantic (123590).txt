Giovanna Micconi
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0500 PM - 0659 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course uses the concept of the "Black Atlantic" as a way to explore key theoretical issues in African, African American, and Caribbean Studies. Interdisciplinary readings will examine the making and the construction of race through different perspectives and experiences. The course is structured in three parts. Part I deals with Critical Race Theory and the "Black Atlantic," seen as a conceptual space as well as a physical space of history formation. Part II looks at Colonial and Postcolonial discourses on race and identity formation in diasporic and colonial settings. Part III explores "Contemporary Diasporas," focusing on contemporary immigration from Africa to the United States as well as examples of return narratives to Africa and to the Caribbean. Assignments will include written work and archival research.
Course Notes: Required for concentrators in African and African American Studies. Open to all undergraduates.
