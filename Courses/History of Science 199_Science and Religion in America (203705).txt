This course examines the history of science and religion, with a focus on the United States. Science and religion are often viewed as intrinsically at odds with each other, but are they?? Or have we over-emphasized a small number of conspicuous conflicts? And wy have certain controversies loomed so large in U.S. historiography? Topic will include the founding father's views of science and religion; the 19th century creation of government-based scientific agencies; the development of research universities as an alternative to denominationally-based higher education; Andrew Dickson White and the "warfare of science and religion" thesis, the trial of Tennessee school teacher John Scopes for teaching evolution and the popular interpretation of that trial; creationism in the mid-late 20th century, and religious-based opposition to climate science. We will pay particular attention to the question of how the relationship between science and religion has changed over the course of U.S. history, and the drivers of those changes.
