         Czeslaw Milosz, Wislawa Szymborska, Zbigniew Herbert, and Adam Zagajewski have been widely read and translated by American poets and critics, who have identified a "Polish School of Poetry" oriented on witnessing history, ethics, and politics, and associated closely with the traumas of World War II and Communist rule. But how accurate is this picture, and what does Polish poetry look like "from the inside"?
In this course, we will combine these perspectives, confronting canonical authors with lesser-known, experimental and contemporary poets, and we will ask how Polish poetry has changed since the democratic transition of 1989. What shapes poetry's role in society? What makes poetry political? Are some kinds of poetry more "translatable" than others, and how does this shape the American reception of Polish poets? Our course discussions will combine close reading with consideration of social and political context (censorship and newspeak); we will also consider recordings and performances, translation and emigration, as well as larger themes of privacy, feminism, and religion.
Course Notes: Intended for all students interested in poetry. No prior knowledge of Polish language or literature is required. All readings will be in English.
