 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
         Students will develop a cohesive, long-term photographic project originating from their own experience. They will be challenged to approach difficult themes, interior emotional content, or imbalances they perceive in the world around them. Subjects may include, but are not limited to, significant events, upheaval, or desire. The course will address the uses of allegory and metaphor in image-making, as well as the mechanics of editing, sequencing, and essay- writing in support of a body of work that conveys an original point of view.
Course Notes: Interested students must attend first meeting of class to speak with teaching staff about enrollment procedures.
