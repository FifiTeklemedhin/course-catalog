 Science of the Physical Universe
             In an age of magnificent astronomical progress and discoveries, the increasing knowledge of the cosmos has manifold repercussions in society and culture. This course will examine how outer space-related phenomena impact, or potentially impact, society and culture, and vice versa. Especially in light of the proliferating discovery of exoplanets, an intriguing topic of astrosociology is presented by the possibility of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, their detection, communication with them, and even contact.
