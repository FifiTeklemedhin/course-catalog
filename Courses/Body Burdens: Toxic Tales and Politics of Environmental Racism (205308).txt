Mercury, Hermes, or quicksilver has seeped into the psyches of philosophers and emperors, mad-hatters, sushi- eaters and cavity-fillers. It can "move" through the body, passing the blood-brain barrier, swim through amniotic fluid, and change the body chemistry of all living organisms. Concentrating on mercury and environmental contaminants, this course places a particular focus on the effects of heavy metals on climate change, environmental racism, and human health. With global contamination levels rising, the United Nations Environment Programme convened the 2013 Minamata Convention. The subsequent treaty aims to reduce human and environmental exposure, by eliminating the heavy metal from pesticides, gold mining, pharmaceuticals, and factory emissions. Some regions of the world lend themselves to specific kinds of analysis and interventions. From the Amazon to the Arctic and Antarctic, mercury pollution in particular has alarmed environmental engineers and social scientists. While quicksilver's effects on the landscape have marked visibility, its impact on human health is not always so easily detected, except in fetal development. Through the figures of the mother-and-child and of nature's body - often gendered female, public health officials and environmental scientists, call for eliminating the mercurial "body burden" placed on human and nonhuman bodies, for a less toxic future.
