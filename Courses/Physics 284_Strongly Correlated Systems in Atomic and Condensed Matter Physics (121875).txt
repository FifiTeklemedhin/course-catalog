Strongly Correlated Systems in Atomic and Condensed Matter Physics (121875)
Eugene Demler
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Explores an emerging interface involving strongly correlated systems in atomic and condensed matter physics. Topics include bosonic and fermionic Hubbard models, strongly interacting systems near Feshbach resonances, magnetism of ultracold atoms, topological states, low dimensional systems, polarons, disorder in interacting systems and many-body localization, Dicke model and superradiance.
