An introduction to electronic circuit design intended to develop circuit intuition and debugging skills through daily design exercises, discussion and hands-on lab exercises. The approach is intensely practical, minimizing theory. Moves quickly from passive circuits to discrete transistors, then concentrates on operational amplifiers, used to make a variety of circuits including integrators, oscillators, regulators, and filters. The digital half of the course treats analog-digital interfacing, emphasizes the use of microcontrollers and programmable logic devices (PLDs).
Course Notes: Physics 223 is the same course as Physics 123; if you are an undergraduate student, please enroll in 123. Limited to 20 students.
