Climate change, urbanization, and conflict mean that global disasters are on the rise. How should the world respond when disasters force people from their homes? How can we better help the world's refugees? This course examines the past, present, and future of the international humanitarian response system. We will explore how Doctors Without Borders, the United Nations, the Red Cross, and other aid agencies came to be and how global response standards, international humanitarian law, and new technologies are shaping worldwide disaster relief. Through interactive discussions and case studies, students will learn how aid workers interact with governments, militaries, and civil society to provide refugee aid. At the end of the course, students can choose to live the refugee experience during a large-scale, weekend outdoor simulated humanitarian response training program together with other students and professional aid workers from around the world.
