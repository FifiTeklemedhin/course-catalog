In the last half of the 20th century, there was gloom about urban life and many cities were projected to decay. Although some did, others became models of urban renaissance. Using Boston as a case study of urban change, this course examines key issues such as economic inequality, political governance, crime and criminal justice institutions (e.g, policing, incarceration), racial segregation, immigration, and gentrification. We draw on a wide range of reading and data sources, as well as presentations by notable local practitioners, student visits to different parts of Boston, and a variety of writing assignments designed to help students better appreciate, understand, and participate in contemporary urban life.
Course Notes: This course, when taken for a letter grade, may be counted for introductory Sociology concentration requirement.
