2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0230 PM - 0529 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course provides a cross-disciplinary overview of environmental science and how research contributes to public policy and human health risk assessment through a case study of a global pollution issue: lead biogeochemistry. The scientific foundations of environmental research methods are discussed (i.e., analytical chemistry, ecology, use of environmental archives, environmental modeling). Experience conducting multidisciplinary environmental research and data analysis will be provided. Course Activities: Lectures, discussions, case studies, field/lab visits.
Recommended Prep: Two semesters of undergraduate chemistry including Physical Sciences 1 or Physical Sciences 11; Mathematics 1a & 1b. Knowledge of basic statistics is
