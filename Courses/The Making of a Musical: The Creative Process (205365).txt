          This course introduces students to the collaborative process of creating a new musical by analyzing the real time development of two world premiere musicals (Jagged Little Pill and American Music) at the American Repertory Theater. In addition to these case studies, the course will examine other existing American musicals including West Side Story, Assassins, Pippin and Waitress. Through readings by historians, theorists and practitioners and visits from artists and professionals across the field, students will learn about the key components of a musical including: book and adaptation; music and lyrics; choreography; and visual design. There will also be a class devoted to the art of producing and the business of musical theater.
Over the course of the semester, students will develop a vision and "pitch" for their own musical project. As a final assignment, the class will collaborate on creative presentations drawn from the proposed musical projects.
As part of this course, students will attend a workshop rehearsal of Jagged Little Pill in New York City and see the A.R.T. production of Waitress on Broadway.
