The goal of this course is to explore a number of the current online tools to analyze genes, gene function, pathways, DNA, RNA, and protein analysis. Each class we will introduce a new online tool. The majority of the class will be spent exploring the tool together in an interactive manner. At the end of each class students will be given an assignment which utilizes the knowledge they gained in class and helps them to further explore the new tool. After taking this class students will be proficient in the use of each online tool and will be able to apply their knowledge to learning new tools and programs.
