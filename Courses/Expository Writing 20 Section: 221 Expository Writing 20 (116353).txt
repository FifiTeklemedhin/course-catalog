controversy over Sally Mann's family photographs, which set off a firestorm of criticism when they were exhibited in 1992. Through a close reading of Mann's memoir, we will try to understand how and why her photographs tested the boundary between private life and public art. In the second unit, we will turn from photography-as-art to the rise of photojournalism, and in particular, to a ground-breaking series of photo-essays from Life magazine on racial segregation in the South. In our final unit, we will grapple with the problem of proof and deception in the digital age by exploring the critical response to the JPEG files shared among soldiers inside the Abu Ghraib prison at the height of the Iraq war.

The Psychology of Success and
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Who gets ahead in America? Why do some succeed while others fail? Given knowledge of someone's background, can we predict if she will become successful? Is it possible to change the course of an individual's trajectory? How do we account for the influence of various complex factors, including family, community, and society? In this course, we will examine questions of success, failure, achievement, and identity viewed through the lens of current theories in psychology. We will begin with The Overachievers, a best-selling journalistic account of the pressure for academic achievement felt by students at an elite public high school on the East Coast. We'll consider how passion, motivation, and competition all contribute to an individual's drive to succeed. Next, we will read Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: The story of success and apply it as a lens to analyze a longitudinal, ethnographic study of 12 American children. We will explore how race, gender, and familial wealth and resources affected these children's lived experiences of childhood and, later, their chances of successfully getting into college. In the final unit of the course, we will use a popular psychology book on habits as a jumping off point to complete independent research

papers that examine how factors like self-control, willpower, mindfulness, and creativity contribute to success. Throughout the course, we will use psychological theory to motivate questions and answers about human behavior in a society where the demand for success can be tantalizingly high and the fear of failure devastatingly relentless.

Documenting Lives
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
In a long-forgotten short story published in 1958, an unloved businessman takes up photography as a hobby only to find himself obsessed by the nature of the medium. He comes to believe that the camera alone can capture and preserve the reality of things and people. "In order to really live," he tells his friends, "you must photograph as much as you can, but to photograph as much as you can you must either live in the most photographable way possible, or else consider photographical every moment of your life." The story writer was inspired by a new fad in the postwar decades: middle-class amateurs taking candid snapshots of everyday life on portable cameras. More than a half-century later, in an age of Instagram and Snapchat, our networked devices go everywhere our bodies go, and we are accustomed to taking and sharing pictures of ourselves and others throughout the day. But what does it mean to document our lives and those of others through photographs? What kind of truth or reality can photographs reveal about ourselves and the world in which we live? And what about our ethical obligations? Do we have a moral responsibility as producers and viewers of photographs? Finally, given the rise of Photoshop and the digital image, how can we even trust what we see?
We will pursue these questions through three case studies, beginning with controversy over Sally Mann's family photographs, which set off a firestorm of criticism when they were exhibited in 1992. Through a close reading of Mann's memoir, we will try to understand how and why her photographs
