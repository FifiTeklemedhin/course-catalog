         Moving together: an examination of music and its role in communication and empathy. From military drill to partner dance to the consolations of song and the political solidarity of taste, moving with, being moved by, and producing music in all its forms is a singularly powerful vehicle for fostering cooperation and attention to one another. In this seminar we will focus on interpersonal aspects of music-making from sociological, psychological, neuropsychological, and music therapeutic perspectives."
