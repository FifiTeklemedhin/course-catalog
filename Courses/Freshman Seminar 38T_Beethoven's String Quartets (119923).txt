Since the late eighteenth century, composers have often reserved their most ambitious and complex thoughts for their string quartets. The ensemble of two violins, viola and cello can create a homogeneous sound but also has an enormous potential for sonic variety. Beethoven's sixteen quartets span almost his entire creative output, ranging from the classical Six Quartets, Op. 18 of 1800, to the transcendent, pioneering late quartets, the last completed in 1826, the year before his death in 1827. These works contain the full range of Beethoven's musical expression. The seminar will work from scores, selected recordings, and live performances connected to the Parker Quartet's Harvard residency. Seminar members will play excerpts from the quartets in class. Everyone shall prepare individual projects. We will also go on a field trip to hear a professional string quartet. Although the primary focus will be on the participants' interpretations of the works, the seminar will also read and discuss texts by Lewis Lockwood, Joseph Kerman, Robert Winter, and others. Our goals are to get to know one of the great collections of works in Western music; to improve listening and score-reading skills; to learn to talk about and write about music.
