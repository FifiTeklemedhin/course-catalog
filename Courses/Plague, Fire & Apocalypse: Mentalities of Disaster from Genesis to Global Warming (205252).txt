Few things have continuously evoked as much terror, public discussion and controversy as disasters. This seminar examines historical disasters from the ancient world to the present day, with a focus on the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of past people about disastrous phenomena. Weekly readings consider the influences of religion, science, philosophy, ecological activism, journalism and fiction on disaster mentalities. The course as a whole invites students to think critically about the respective roles of 'nature', morality and expert authority in disasters. Students will compose an original research paper on a topic of their choice related to themes of the course.
