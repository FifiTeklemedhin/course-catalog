The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive overview of DSM-5 feeding and eating disorders (EDs) with a primary focus on anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. We will explore the etiology (i.e., biological and environmental factors), symptom presentation, and empirically supported treatments across these EDs. Additional topics will include cultural considerations, gender and EDs, medical complications, impact of media/social media, and novel directions and treatments for these disorders.
