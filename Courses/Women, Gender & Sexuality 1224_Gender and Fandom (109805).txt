This course examines the gendered experiences of those who identify as "fans" through the lens of anthropology, sociology, and gender studies. We will examine a wide variety of fandoms and ask questions such as, how does fandom shape gender expression? How does gender shape fandom? How are class, race, and cultural background implicated in fan expressions? How do fans create community? Who is welcomed and who is excluded from fan communities? We will examine particular fandoms, including online fandoms, sports fandoms, and sci-fi/fantasy fandoms, among others, and read works by sociologists, anthropologists, and the fans themselves.
