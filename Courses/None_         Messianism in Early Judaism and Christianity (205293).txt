Messianism is one of the messiest, most fraught topics in the history of early Christianity and Judaism. This seminar will trace the evolution and development of the many different ideas of the messiah—his character, his fate, his role in history—from its Ancient Near Eastern beginnings through the Hebrew Bible into early Jewish and Christian tradition up until the early Middle Ages. We will also pay attention to parallel developments in the Greco- Roman world. Topics to be studied include the semi-divinity of the messiah, the idea of the suffering or dying messiah, and the relationship between messianism and apocalypticism. Readings will include primary sources as well as the relevant secondary literature. All readings will be provided in English translation and (in the case of
