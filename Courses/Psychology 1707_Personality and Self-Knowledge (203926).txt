         This course focuses on the role that personality plays in determining behavior. Cognitive, emotional, and motivational aspects of personality will be covered. For example, what leads people to be rigid in their beliefs versus open to new ideas and experiences? Why are some people motivated by money and others are motivated to form relationships? Topics include: self-knowledge –how well do we know ourselves? What do we know about ourselves? How well do others know us?; personality stability and change –who are you if your personality is not stable?; maladaptive personalities –both in the "normal" range as well as personality disorders. This course takes a modern approach to personality and also introduces methodological advances and techniques such as using smart phones to record data and room observation –what can you tell about someone from their living spaces and belongings?
