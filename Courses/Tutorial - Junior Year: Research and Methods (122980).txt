         The course is organized to support student success in writing a junior research paper. We will read a variety of texts and interrogate closely how topics are approached in literary and cultural studies, in social and historical studies, and in life-sciences, in order to become prepared to discuss critically different methodological approaches and theoretical frames. Students will also work with an individual tutor, who will guide them through their research and writing on the particular topic of their interest.
