         How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? Do high- end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How does Spotify predict your next favorite song? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for non-engineering concentrators. The class is driven by hands-on group projects to enhance your technical literacy, a critical skill for anyone designing solutions to today's most pressing and complex issues. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. Requires no previous exposure to physics or calculus beyond the high school level.
