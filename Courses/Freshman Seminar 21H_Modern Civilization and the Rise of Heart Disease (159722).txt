         Heart diseases have plagued humans since ancient times, but only in the past century has heart disease become epidemic throughout the world. Despite great progress in prevention and therapy, heart diseases will be major causes of death and disability throughout the next century. Modernization of civilization has played a major role in the rise of heart disease. Conversely, advances in heart disease have powerfully changed society and our personal daily behavior. In this seminar, we will examine some of the major intersection events between heart disease and modern society over the past century and consider how this could change the next century in America and throughout the world. The topics include dramatic events like a young physician inserting a urinary drainage tube into his heartâ€”ultimately generating the modern life-saving treatment for heart attacks. We will explore how major lifestyle factors such as tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet affect health, and how economics and politics often play a role in the complex relationship of health and society. In addition, we will visit a high technology modern cardiology facility and watch some technology in action.
