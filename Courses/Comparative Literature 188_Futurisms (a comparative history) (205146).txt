         From its foundation in Feb. 1909 through WWII, futurism developed into the first international cultural-political avant- garde. Its aim was a revolutionary transformation of all spheres of life and its influence extended to the whole of Europe, parts of Asia, and the Americas. Combating the tradi-tionalism of turn-of-the-century European culture, the move-ment sought to found a cosmopolitan (but nationalist) countercul-ture based on the exaltation of youth, speed, violent revolt, innovation, and expe-ri-menta-tion. Hence the move-ment's name: the label "Future-ism" denoting at once adoration of the new and struggle against the prevalence of "past-ism" or passatismo (the idolatry of the past). In its first decade of ex-is-tence Futurism became the first full-fledged cultural/political avant-garde of our cen-tury, ga-ther-ing together pain-ters, musi-cians, archi-tects, political revo-lu-tion-aries, and poets from seve-ral European nations. A key progenitor of later move-ments such as Dada-, Vorticism, and Sur-real-ism, Fu-tur-ism had a powerful forma-tive influence not only on the cul-tural atmo-s-phere of Italy during the Fascist
era (1922-1945), but also on 20th century cul-ture as a whole.
