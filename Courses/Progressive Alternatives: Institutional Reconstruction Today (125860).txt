 Moral Reasoning
           An exploration of the past and future agenda of progressives, whether self-described as liberals or as leftists. What should they propose, now that they no longer believe in the usefulness of governmental direction of the economy or in the sufficiency of redistributive social programs? How can democracies and markets be reorganized to suit progressive goals? Emphasis on the structural imagination about society and its institutional alternatives in which contemporary social science and political discourse are deficient. Readings from several disciplines and examples from many countries.
