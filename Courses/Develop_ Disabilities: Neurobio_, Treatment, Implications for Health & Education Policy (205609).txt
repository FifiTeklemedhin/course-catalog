2018 Spring (400 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 40
Developmental disabilities are highly prevalent and have a substantial impact on the health and educational outcomes of affected children and their families. This course will provide a comprehensive overview of the most common developmental disabilities, including autism, developmental dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and others. Students will review etiological models from different theoretical perspectives with a primary focus on neurodevelopmental trajectories, cognitive variables and environmental factors. We will further discuss diagnostic criteria, symptomatology and key interventional strategies as well as comorbidities and protective factors. This information will be embedded into discussions pertaining to the intersection between typical and atypical neurodevelopment and health/education policy.
