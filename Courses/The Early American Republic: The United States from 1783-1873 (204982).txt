         This course will explore the creation of the United States after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War through the presidency of Andrew Jackson. We will focus on politics, social and cultural life during this period. We will discuss, among other things, the concepts of republicanism and federalism, the French and Haitian Revolutions' effect on politics in the 1790s, Jefferson versus Hamilton, slavery, and attitudes toward Native Americans and women. Other topics: Jefferson's election in 1800, the War of 1812, the initial conflicts over slavery, the calls for a "white man's government" and the overall effects of Jackson's presidency.
