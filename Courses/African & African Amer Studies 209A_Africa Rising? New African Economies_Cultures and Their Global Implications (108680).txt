2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0600 PM - 0759 PM M 1200 PM - 0129 PM
Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
In a story titled Africa Rising (2011), The Economist argued that the continent epitomizes both the "transformative promise of [capitalist ]growth and its bleakest dimensions." This workshop will explore Africa's changing place in the world - and the new economies, legalities, socialities, and cultural forms that have arisen there. It will also interrogate the claim that the African present is a foreshadowing of processes beginning to occur elsewhere; that, therefore, it is a productive source of theory about current conditions world-wide. The workshop, open to faculty and students, will meet Mondays from 6:00-8:00. 15 students will be permitted to take it as a course; they will also meet on Mondays, 12:00-1:30. Grades will be based on participation and a term essay.
Class Notes: Class meets on Mondays from 12pm - 1pm and 6pm - 8pm. Additional Course Attributes:
