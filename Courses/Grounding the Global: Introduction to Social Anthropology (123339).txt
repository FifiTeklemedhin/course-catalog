         How does social anthropology - the study and representation of contemporary societies through fieldwork and ethnographic writing - critically and constructively intervene in the contemporary world? This course shows the value of anthropological perspective (with its emphases on cultural particularity and everyday experience) for understanding global issues such as religion, globalization, and modernity; technoscience, medicine, and the shifting definitions of life and death; and emerging notions of time and the future.
