2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule:
Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Is there such a thing as "authentic" Mexican cuisine? Where do menu items like tacos, burritos, guacamole, and margaritas have their origins? When the Spanish arrived in Mexico nearly 500 years ago, they were amazed by the variety of food and drinks they had never seen before--tomatoes of all kinds and colors, chili peppers, spices like chocolate and vanilla, tortillas, tamales, alcoholic drinks made from fermented agave sap, and more. While historical accounts provide an important starting point to understanding what Aztec cuisine was like in the 1500s, archaeology is revealing the diversity of ancient Mexican food, drink, and cultures, across time and space.This course introduces students to Mexican cuisine from an archaeological perspective, and examines how foodways intersect with social phenomena such as status, ethnicity, gender, and religion. Topics include the "Paleo-diet" of early hunter-gatherers; farming and feasting in early villages; how tortillas and other inventions were important to the rise of towns, temples, and urbanism; food and drink in sacrifice and ritual; courtly behavior and regional cuisines; food production, marketplaces, and political economy; the Columbian exchange and the beginnings of modern cuisine. Hands-on activities, food tastings, and Peabody Museum collections will be incorporated into class discussions and assignments, as students gain a deeper understanding of the archaeology of ancient Mexico.
