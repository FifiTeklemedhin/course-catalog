Becoming Human: New Techniques to Investigate an Ancient Story (205499)
Kate Carter
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0300 PM - 0429 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
In this class we will take an in-depth look at the human evolutionary story. In addition to the typical "stones and bones" approach to our origin, you'll use game theory, evolutionary modeling, and participant observation to analyze how evolution made humans the way they are. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding major ongoing debates in human origins and why these debates exist. Students will complete in-class lab and discussion activities to enhance their understanding, but there is no additional course component.
