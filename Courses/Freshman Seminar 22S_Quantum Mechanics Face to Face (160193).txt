T 0230 PM - 0429 PM 12
This course is for students who would like to be introduced to the ideas of quantum mechanics without the rigor of mathematics but who would be interested in learning by demonstration as well as spoken word and picture. We will be guided by a non-mathematical text Introducing Quantum Theory, read short pieces by the creators of quantum theory, including Bohr, EInstein, Hesienberg and Schrodinger, and each week watch and play with physics demonstrations of wave and particle physics. This course requires reading, watching short films, watching demonstrations in the lab and visiting places at the university where quantum mechanics is used on a daily basis.
