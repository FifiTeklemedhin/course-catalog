Manja Klemencic
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1200 PM - 1259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 30
This Undergraduate Engaged Scholarship Course seeks to integrate the scholarship on sociology of higher education with (i) the service work that Harvard undergraduates conduct at Harvard for other students and for the University, and (ii) their political work in the area of higher education policy and regulation. Students' grasp of basic theories and concepts in sociology of higher education will be reinforced through their experiential learning in two distinct yet related spheres of student engagement. One is the students' engagement in University policy and service. The other is the students' engagement with state and federal higher education policy and regulation; student groups at other colleges and universities; and educational foundations and think-tanks. Active involvement of community partners from within the University and beyond is one integral part of the course. The other is students' participatory action research.
