This course encourages and supports the creation of video projects with the moving body as subject. A brief, comprehensive study on the use of editing software (Final Cut Pro) will be covered at the start of the semester, followed by a study on dance film as genre, paying close attention to works by previous dance film awardees from the annual Dance on Camera Film Festival. The course will include storyboarding, shooting, conceptual thinking vs. literal representation, pre/post video editing, and culminate in a final dance film project.
