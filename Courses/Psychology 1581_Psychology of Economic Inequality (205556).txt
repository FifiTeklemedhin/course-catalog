         Every society in the world is structured such that some people earn higher incomes, have greater access to resources, and enjoy more social power and status than others. Scholars across several disciplines have sought to explain why income inequality is ubiquitous and persistent. In this course, we are particularly concerned with how features of the mind, and the mind in society, help explain the widening gap between the rich and the poor. How do people perceive income inequality, and how do those perceptions influence their social attitudes and policy positions? Why do people who stand to benefit from redistribution sometimes oppose it? How do we decide what's fair, and when do perceptions of fairness emerge in human development? How does perceived lack of control or power affect the psychology of low-status groups, and how do those effects, in turn, influence power imbalances? In answering these questions, we'll consider a diversity of perspectives from the literatures on evolutionary and developmental psychology, social psychology, political science and social policy.
