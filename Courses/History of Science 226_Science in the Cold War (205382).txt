       This seminar examines the broad and multifaceted interaction between science and the Cold War. In the years between 1945 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, science was enrolled in a remarkable range of ideological, cultural, political, and technological projects. In what ways did Cold War priorities and institutions shape the development of modern science? How did modern science make the Cold War? Readings will include classic and recent works that have explored and critiqued the notion of "Cold War science."
