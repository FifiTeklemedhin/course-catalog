Cleopatra to Catwoman, or even Nicki Minaj's media persona. In most stories, the femme fatale's dangerous actions empower her, but she ultimately must also submit to the idea that her empowerment renders her a villain. How does this contradiction in the femme fatale's character reflect tensions in our own evolving understanding of gender? How can the femme fatale character help us untangle the real gender problems that modern women and men face? This course will begin to explore these and other related questions by studying accounts of femme fatales in literature and film. In our first unit, we'll explore 1920s and 1930s pulp fiction as a source of the modern fatale archetype, with special focus on James M. Cain's noir novella Double Indemnity. In our second unit, we'll move to a fictional account of a more powerful femme fatale published in the 1970's post- feminist movement, and examine Stephen King's novel Carrie alongside the updated film adaptation, Brian de Palma's eponymous cult classic. Finally, in our third unit, students will research a modern day femme fatale, either real or fictional, and argue why the modern version is recognizable as a femme fatale, but also represents some evolution of, or twist on, the classic archetype. Here students will be challenged not only to apply broad theories and ideas from the course, but also to reach a greater understanding of what makes some modern women seem so dangerous.

The femme fatale--the attractive, seductive woman who brings about the downfall of any man she encountersâ€”has fascinated us through the ages, from Biblical figures like Eve, Delilah, and Salome and Ancient Egypt's Cleopatra to Catwoman, or even Nicki Minaj's media persona. In most stories, the femme fatale's dangerous actions empower her, but she ultimately must also submit to the idea that her empowerment renders her a villain.
