         Students gain research skills along with an understanding of the production of sociological knowledge through work on faculty research projects. Work is arranged and directed by faculty members, who supervise and meet with students regularly (every 1-2 weeks). The specifics of the intellectual goals for the student and the research tasks involved will vary. The student and faculty member will consult on this in advance and will outline the following on the 92r Registration Form: 1) the specific skills to be learned, 2) how the course will engage students with the discipline, and 3) the specific work product. What students produce will depend on the kind of research involved. It is expected that students will work 8 to 10 hours per week on the course. Students may engage with data collection, data analysis, literature reviews, or other aspects of a faculty project.
