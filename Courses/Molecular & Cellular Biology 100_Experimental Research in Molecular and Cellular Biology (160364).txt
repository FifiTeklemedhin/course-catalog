             A laboratory course that immerses students in a dynamic project-based research environment. Participate in experimental projects directly linked with ongoing faculty research. Students select a project from the following research tracks: neurobiology, microbial sciences, cell biology, and synthetic biology. New projects, including some in other research fields, are offered every term. In a highly collaborative atmosphere, students form a fully-functional and diverse research group based on the sharing of ideas and progress reports between projects. The spring microbiology project is part of the "genomes to Biomes" series. This course cannot be taken concurrently with LifeSci 100
Recommended Prep: LPS A or LS 1a or permission of the instructor. Students interested in a neurobiology project will need MCB 80 or permission of the instructor.
