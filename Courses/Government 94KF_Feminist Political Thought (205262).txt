2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0400 PM - 0559 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 16
This course is an introduction to feminist political thought since the mid-twentieth century. It explores the key arguments that have preoccupied radical, socialist and liberal feminists: What and who is a woman? How do the state, the law and the economy shape gender relations? Should housework be waged? How does gender relate to class and race? Are prostitutes victims or workers? Does 'women's liberation' remain the 'longest revolution'?
