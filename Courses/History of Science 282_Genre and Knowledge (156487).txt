         How and to what extent is knowledge shaped by the forms and genres through which it has been produced? Bringing history of science and technology together with media studies, book history, and cultural theory, we will consider histories and theories of representation, textuality, authorship, reading, illustration, translation, and the archive. Readings will include Foucault, Chartier, Latour, Kittler, Daston, Biagioli, Gitelman, Elshakry, and Kirschenbaum.
