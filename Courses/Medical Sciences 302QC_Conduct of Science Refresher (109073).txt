This course is a required course for all DMS students and all who receive support from NIH training grants. The goal of this course is to inform students about the appropriate conduct of research and the many ethical and social problems that they may encounter during their research career in graduate school. The course consists of three lectures for the entire class and five highly interactive sessions with a small group of fellow students moderated by a faculty member. Some of the issues that will be discussed in this course include appropriate methods of collecting laboratory data, interactions with members of the laboratory and the mentor and issues dealing with research misconduct.
All current G5 students must register for this course on their Fall Semester 2017 study cards. G5 students are required to attend at least two out of the three didactic sessions. Specific enrollment instructions will be sent to current G5s and other eligible students in the upcoming weeks. Please contact Tatevik Holmgren ( Tatevik_Holmgren@hms.harvard.edu) for enrollment inquiries. Restricted to GSAS graduate students on the Longwood campus.
