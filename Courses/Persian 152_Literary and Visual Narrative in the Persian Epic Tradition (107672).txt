Foundational to Iranian cultural identity and a masterpiece of world literature, the Shahnameh of Abolqasem Ferdowsi (ca. 940 â€“1019) can be said to epitomize the essential features of Persian epic, much like Homer's Iliad
and Odyssey for Greek. With its unique combination of mythical, heroic and historical components, the Persian Book of Kings is also one of the most widely illustrated narratives in the Islamicate arts of the book. Alongside the reading of the Shahname in Dick Davis' authoritative English translation, students will become acquainted with the great Persian epic as a living tradition of telling and retelling in written, visual and oral form. Topics include the elements of marvel, romance and ethics characteristic of the epic genre, and the relationship between the text of the poem and its manuscript illustrations.
Course Notes: Knowledge of Persian not required. Lectures and readings will be in English, and a separate section will be arranged for students with adequate reading
