         Starting from the definition of Abstract Elementary Classes (AECs), we will develop nonforking and classification theory for tame AECs. These classes are general enough to encompass interesting examples of nonelementary classes, but have enough structure to develop a reasonable classification theory. We will cover the construction of good frames and other nonforking notions in tame AECs; examples of tame AECs; and the impact of set theory and large cardinals.
