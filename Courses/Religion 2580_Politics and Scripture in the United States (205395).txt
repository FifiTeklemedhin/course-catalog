Course participants will consider together how to construct a course about the intersection of the interpretation of scripture with key political and social issues in the history of the United States. Topics to be considered include the formation of canon, the history of scriptural interpretation in the academy, colonization, race, slavery, women's rights, public education, the Bible and state violence, LGBTQ rights, and the parallels between scriptural and constitutional interpretation. In addition, course members will discuss issues of pedagogy, syllabus construction, and teaching with objects, including materials at the Houghton. While this is aimed especially for those thinking about undergraduate teaching, those interested in teaching settings in religious contexts and elementary and high schools are also welcome.
