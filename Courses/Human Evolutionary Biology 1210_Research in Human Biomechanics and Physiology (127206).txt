Introduces students to experimental techniques used to investigate the musculoskeletal structure and physiology of humans. Students undertake a supervised research project in the Skeletal Biology and Biomechanics Laboratory. Students meet to introduce their project, discuss their work and progress, and to present their final results, as well as for several lectures on writing and presenting research findings. An extensive commitment of time in the laboratory is required. Grades are based on the work completed, the oral presentation, and a short research paper.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the research seminar concentration requirement for Human Evolutionary Biology
Recommended Prep: Life Sciences 2 or Human Evolutionary Biology 1420 or Organismic Evolutionary Biology 173 are required prerequisite courses.
