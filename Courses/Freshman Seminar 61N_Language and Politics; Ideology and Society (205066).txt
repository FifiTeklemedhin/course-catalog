interactions. Some of the work we will do involves analysis (what, exactly, is the difference between lying to someone and simply misleading her?), work that is worth doing in part because it will help us in thinking about normative questions (is lying worse than merely misleading in some morally significant way?) Some of the work we will do involves recovering and analyzing arguments in philosophy and elsewhere about issues concerning speech—for example, arguments for and against the claim that certain sorts of speech (hate speech, pornography) ought to be restricted because of various harms. And some of the work we'll do will require that we engage important but fairly hairy philosophical questions whether—for example, the (putative) fact that we see the world through one or another ideology makes knowledge impossible, or whether there are (interesting) absolute normative truths. The course as a whole is an introduction to philosophy that emphasizes philosophy's ability to help us understand and criticize our social situation.
