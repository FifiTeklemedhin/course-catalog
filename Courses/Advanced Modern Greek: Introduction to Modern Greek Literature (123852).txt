Special Topic: From Book to Film: Cinematic Representations of Modern Greek Literature. How do words translate into images? Can the interpretively fraught perspective of an author lend itself to the sensorily rife gaze of a director? Is it possible for an enthralling book to evolve into an equally astounding film? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this course, as students gain knowledge about significant events in Modern Greek history that have long preoccupied and inspired acclaimed authors and distinguished filmmakers alike. Through engagement in narrative analysis and interpretation students will also be encouraged to whet their critical reading and writing skills. Authors include: Ioanna Karystiane, Nikos Kazantzakes, Strates Myriveles, Alexandros Papadiamantes, Kosmas Polites, Giorgos Skampardones, Dido Soteriou, Kostas Tachtses, and Georgios Vizyenos. Directors include, among others: Jules Dassin, Michales Kakoyannes, Kostas Koutsomytes, and Panteles Voulgares.
