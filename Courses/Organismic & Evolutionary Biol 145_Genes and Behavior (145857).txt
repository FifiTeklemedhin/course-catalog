         Behavior is inheritable and regulated by genes. This lecture course explores the causal links between the genes encoded in the genome and various behaviors, aiming to provide mechanistic understandings on how gene products control and influence behavioral outputs. The topics of the lectures cover both important findings as well as major research approaches in the field. The behavioral traits in discussion include olfaction, mechanosensation, foraging, circadian rhythm, aggression, courtship, sleep, social recognition, learning and memory, etc. The organisms that we will discuss include invertebrates, vertebrates and humans. Life Science 1a.
Course Notes: The class will include a new 4-week lab component for research experience on genetic basis of behavior in Fall 2016.
