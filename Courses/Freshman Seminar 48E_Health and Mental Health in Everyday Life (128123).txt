Health and Mental Health in Everyday Life (128123)

Why do students feel ill before an exam? Why do women seem to suffer more than men from depression and eating disorders, whereas men use and abuse substances more than women? Why do some race/ethnic groups have better or worse health and mental health outcomes than others? These are some of the questions this course addresses. Using interdisciplinary perspectives we will investigate how such social and personal characteristics as gender, race/ethnicity, family background, and self-esteem impact health and mental health behaviors and outcomes. We will also examine how specific configurations of circumstances and contexts contribute to health and mental health problems. For instance, college students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, etc., are increasingly experiencing stress and turning to amphetamines at higher rates than young adults who are not in college. One goal in these classes will be to explore causes and consequences. Another will be to understand the role of individuals themselves, their personal and social support networks, and health care professionals in developing and guiding positive strategies for coping and healing. Throughout, we traverse the boundary between health and illness in order to understand the complex web of factors that create and jeopardize well-being. Students will present analyses of the readings in class and write short papers based on class readings and discussions, as well as additional research. Students will also give two brief presentations: a team project and a representation of health and/or mental health in the arts.
