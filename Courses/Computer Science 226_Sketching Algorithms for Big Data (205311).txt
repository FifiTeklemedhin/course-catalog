Big data is data so large that it does not fit in the main memory of a single machine. The need to process big data by space-efficient algorithms arises in Internet search, machine learning, network traffic monitoring, scientific computing, signal processing, and other areas. This course will cover mathematically rigorous models for developing such algorithms, as well as some provable limitations of algorithms operating in those models. Some topics covered include streaming algorithms, dimensionality reduction and sketching, randomized algorithms for numerical linear algebra, sparse recovery and the sparse Fourier transform. The course will also cover some applications of these methods.
Recommended Prep: CS 124; knowledge of discrete probability and linear algebra.
