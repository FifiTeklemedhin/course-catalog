How can we understand modern society through art? How can modern art connect theories of politics and culture to lived experience? How do artworks, artistic communities, and visions of art serve as the basis to analyze –and in some instances, change –the features of modern life? This tutorial seeks to answer these questions by combining the empirical study of the contemporary art scene with an historical survey of the performing, visual, and literary arts from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, emphasizing how the convergence of art and politics has negotiated boundaries between fact and fiction, nature and technology, the local and the global, private and public, protest and participation, consumer and producer, reason and intuition, the body and object. Our focus will be on Europe, Russia/USSR, and the United States, though examples from throughout the globe (esp East Asia) will be considered as well. Weekly assignments will combine primary source readings, screenings, and listening sessions

with secondary texts in history, anthropology, philosophical aesthetics, social theory, and science studies. Together, we will attempt to answer to answer the deceptively simple question: what does it mean to be modern? This is a junior tutorial.
