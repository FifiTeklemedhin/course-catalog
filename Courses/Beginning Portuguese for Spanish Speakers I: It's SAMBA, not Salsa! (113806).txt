Designed specifically for students with a sound knowledge of Spanish. This course presents linguistic and cultural structures necessary for basic communication, emphasizing the features of Portuguese most challenging for Spanish Speakers: pronunciation, idioms, and grammatical structures peculiar to Brazilian Portuguese. Over the course of the semester, students learn to express themselves effectively using their Brazilian voice, distinct from their Spanish voice. Students experience contextualized Lusophone culture through music, social media, and Teletandem, a weekly online interaction with college students in Brazil, unique to the Portuguese Program.
