What does it mean to "sample"? What is a good research question, and how can you go about answering it? What do we do about bias in our research designs? This seminar offers an introductory overview of qualitative research methods in sociology. Through a series of hands-on, applied exercises and practical case-studies, students will learn what qualitative research looks like in the real world. Students will receive training in the basic instruments, sampling strategies, data collections, practical dilemmas, and common problems of different methodological approaches. We will learn about the advantages and limitations of interview-based, survey, ethnographic, and archival research. Throughout the semester, students will have weekly applications of methods, including with programs such as Atlas.ti and Nvivo. We will learn how to formulate research questions, conceptualize social phenomena, create research designs, code and operationalize, collect data, and interpret and present findings for different purposes.
