This course explores the fundamental skills of improvisation and composition. Using wide-ranging music, experimentation, problem solving, and an equal curiosity about both success and failure â€”this course investigates
the processes of analytical and intuitive decision making in the dancing body. Students will learn a series of specific physical tasks, tools, and systems taught through intensive exercises, guided improvisations and rigorous real-time composition. Physical research and written work in the course connect dance to architecture, the visual arts, mathematics, philosophy, science, theater, and literature in ways which link the mind and body to innovation. Fall 2017 will focus on site-specific research.
Course Notes: Enrollment determined by interview during the first week of class. Minimal dance experience required.
