Irwin Shapiro
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Science is like well-woven, ever-expanding fabric, designed to (un)cover Nature's secrets. This course emphasizes the strong connections between subfields of science, showing it as the never-ending and greatest detective story ever told, with evidence always the arbiter. These characteristics are exhibited in the semi-historical treatment of three themes: unveiling the universe, the earth and its fossils, and the story of life.
