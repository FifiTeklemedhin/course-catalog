   By focusing on literary narratives, cultural representations, and critical theories, this course explores ways in which issues related to migration create rich and complex interdisciplinary conversations. How do humanistic disciplines address these issues —human rights, cultural translation, global justice, security, citizenship, social discrimination, biopolitics —and what contributions do they make to the "home" disciplines of migration studies such as law, political science, and sociology? How do migration narratives compel us to revise our concepts of culture, polity, neighborliness, and community? We will explore diverse aspects of migration from existential, ethical, and philosophical perspectives while engaging with specific regional and political histories. Includes regular participation in the Mahindra Humanities Center Mellon Seminar on migration and the humanities.
