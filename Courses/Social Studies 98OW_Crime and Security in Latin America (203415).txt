This course examines how governing through crime has become a dominant mode of power in Latin America and considers the political and social effects that such regime of governance has thus far produced. Combining social theory with ethnographic case studies –which include the "war on drugs" in Colombia and in Mexico, security tactics and aesthetics in urban Brazil, gang sovereignty and violence in El Salvador and Honduras, informal economies, smuggling, and unauthorized migration on the U.S.-Mexico border, among others –we will analyze historical, economic, and cultural processes that have shaped the organized brutalities and petty delinquencies in the region. The underlying questions throughout the semester will be the following: Who has the power to outlaw particular activities and what is the logic behind designating people who engage in them as criminals? How do security policies and strategies shape the urban environment, and why does security buildup, such as militarization of borders and the building of fortified enclaves, create, rather than reduce insecurity While laws establish formal boundaries between the legal and the illegal, how does a bottom-up approach to the lived experiences of crime blur this separation? The main goal of this course to understand the entanglement between crime and security from a perspective that does not take the state or its legal categories for granted. This is a junior tutorial.
