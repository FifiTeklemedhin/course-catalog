The seminar centers on Bizet's Carmen, the opera that shocked 19th-century Europe for its bold expression of seduction and sexuality. Further consideration is given to historical precedents and consequences, from Mozart's Don Giovanni to Strauss's SalomeÃÅ, including Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and Parsifal as counter-examples of non- seduction. Discussions of literary, historical, and theoretical materials (e.g., Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Freud, Th. Mann, Bloch) complement musical analyses and rehearsals of selected pieces, with a public performance at the end of the semester. Open to performers and non-performers.
