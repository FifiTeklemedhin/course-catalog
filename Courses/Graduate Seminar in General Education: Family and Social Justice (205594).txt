Graduate Seminar in General Education: Family and Social Justice (205594)
Regina Schouten
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: T 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 30
In this seminar, we'll work together to design a course that examines the role families play in perpetuating social injustice. Consider the animating problem: We seem to have wide moral prerogative to take special care of those we love, including especially members of our families. But the institution of the family seriously hinders attempts to make society more just, as evidenced by the many ways families transfer advantage across generations. What are we to make of this tension between social justice and the family, and what—if anything—can we do to resolve it? These questions are deeply important for our own lives, and will be deeply important for the lives of the students we go on to explore them with. I hope our group will include participants from different social and disciplinary backgrounds, and correspondingly that the courses we design will incorporate readings and methodologies that reflect our diversity. Most of the readings for our seminar will be scholarship on the central substantive questions outlined above, and each participant will have the opportunity to propose readings for us to consider together. We will engage with the material both as scholarship and as possible content for our subsequent courses, and participants will write regular discussion memos on the readings. Each participant will also read a book on pedagogy or learning theory, and write a precis of the book for the class. The sustained pedagogical project of the course will be to build an understanding of student-centered course design by practicing it in the context of the course we'll be designing together.
