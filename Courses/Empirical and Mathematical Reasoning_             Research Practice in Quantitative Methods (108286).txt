This class introduces students to a variety of statistical methods used to investigate political phenomena. We will address the principles behind these methods, their application, and their limitations. The course will be useful to those undertaking a quantitative methods thesis in Government, but not solely. Indeed, the course aims to provide anyone interested in political science with a proficient understanding of the intuitions behind several of the methods used to analyze political data and identify causal paths. By the end of the course, students will have acquired important analytical and practical skills and will be able to evaluate the quality and reliability of scholarly and journalistic work done using quantitative methods. Students will learn statistical software skills (STATA). For the
