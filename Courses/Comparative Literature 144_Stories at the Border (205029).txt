          In many ways, globalization and technological advances have made the world a more open and interconnected place than ever before. Yet around the world, borders remain sites of violence and seemingly intractable conflict. The course asks two interrelated questions: how authors and filmmakers represent such conflicts, and how the genres in which they work shape our understandings of the issues themselves. We will explore several different genres of visual and textual representation from around the world that bear witness to border conflict –novels, short stories, poetry, graphic novels, memoirs, films, and photo essays –many of which also trouble the borders according to which genres are typically separated and defined. The course begins with an overview of theories of space and boundary-making (eg Baud and Van Schendel, Butler, Foucault, Appadurai, Mignolo, Anzaldúa) through the lense of the ersatz border city of Beszel/Ul Qoma in China Miéville's The City and the City, and various discussions of boundaries in the short stories of Juan José Saer. In the rest of the course we apply these concepts to border- troubling narratives in three world regions.
