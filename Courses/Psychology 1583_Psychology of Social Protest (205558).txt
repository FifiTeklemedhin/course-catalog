         This course examines the psychological factors that drive people to engage incollective action to improve the status and standing of their social group, or toprotest the status quoâ€”as was seen, for example, in the Civil Rights
Movement of the mid-twentieth century, the Occupy Wall Street protests, the Arab Spring, and the recent Women's March. The course begins with an introduction to the psychology of social groups, including perspectives from the literatures on social identity and self-categorization theory. We'll consider the conditions that cause people to be more likely to collectively challenge the status quo, as well as the equally compelling question of why low-status groups often don't protest inequity and injustice. Later in the course, we'll explore predictors of normative versus nonnormative collective action, and consider the problem of terrorism. What drives radicalization, and why are some people willing to die in order to inflict harm on others? In addressing these questions, the course incorporates perspectives from moral and political psychology, political science, and personality psychology.
