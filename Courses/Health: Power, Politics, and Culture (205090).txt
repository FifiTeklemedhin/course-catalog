         In this Junior Tutorial, students will conduct original research relating to the sociology of health. How do we, as a society, decide what constitutes healthy or unhealthy behavior? When one becomes mentally or physically ill, how does this shape their social relations and experiences? What do transformations in the field of biomedicine mean for understanding individual risk and responsibility? Why do people hold certain beliefs about the government's role in healthcare provision? The course begins with an overview of key questions in the field relating to health values and

lifestyles, the experience of illness, biomedicine, and the politics of healthcare provision. Within each substantive section we will pay particular attention to health inequalities relating to race, class, and gender. After the initial weeks of class, students will have developed a project proposal relevant to the course theme. The remainder of the course concentrates on research methodology, data collection and analysis, and workshopping projects. The focus will be on interview-based and content analysis research.
