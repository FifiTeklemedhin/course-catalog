         This course examines the political challenges posed by global warming from both an empirical and a normative perspective. Drawing on a broad array of readings, we investigate why the global community has done so little to combat climate change; what kinds of domestic and international institutions we need to coordinate our response to global warming; whether we should prioritize mitigation or adaptation; and what a just response to climate change might look like.
Class Notes: Undergraduate seminar. Enrollment by lottery. Please see Gov Dept undergraduate website for details.
