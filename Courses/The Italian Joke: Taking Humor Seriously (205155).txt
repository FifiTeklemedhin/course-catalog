This course explores humor as an invitation to critical reading and critical reading as a way of better appreciating humor. We will read a number of books that are hard to classify within a unique genre: this is part of where their humor comes from. We assume that a book is funny because of its underlying complexity, something created with intention and talent and attention to detail. Primary authors include Luigi Pirandello, NiccoloÌ€ Machiavelli, Natalia Ginzburg, Giovanni Boccaccio and Italo Calvino.
