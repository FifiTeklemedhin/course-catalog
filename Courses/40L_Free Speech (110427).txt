In this age of rapid globalization and heightened cross-cultural contacts, nations struggle to reaffirm their identities and values. In the United States, one of the most precious values is free speech, embedded in the First Amendment to the Constitution and regarded as a keystone of American democracy. But arguments over the boundaries of free speech have become intense, especially in the era of electronic communication. This seminar will examine the dialogue taking place within the United States and around the world on free speech issues –sometimes civil, but often a political or cultural confrontation that turns violent. We will discuss international and domestic protests over politically sensitive cartoons, controversies over Holocaust denial, whether hate speech should be banned on campuses, whether the domestic media can ever be legitimately constrained on national security grounds, whether anti-gay religious activists have a right to disrupt military funerals, whether pornography and violent music lyrics should be regulated, and what constitutes free speech on the Internet or cell phones. Through Supreme Court decisions and by other means, we will examine the debate over what it means to be patriotic and whether patriotism requires Americans to say, or prohibits them from saying, certain things –and examine how standards have changed over the years. We will ask whether other countries' attitudes toward free speech and the other First Amendment freedoms should influence US foreign policy toward those countries. Examples of constraints on free speech in our daily lives and work, unwitting or not, will also be considered.
