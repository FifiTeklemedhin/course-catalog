         Course will present our current knowledge of the ocean ridge system where two thirds of Earth's crust is continually being created. We will examine the progressive understanding of ocean ridges from a historical perspective, emphasizing the process of scientific discovery. Topics include melt generation in the mantle, magmatic processes in the crust, formation of ocean ridge topography, faulting and tectonics, hydrothermal systems, manifestations in the overlying water column, and the unique ecosystems associated with vents. Approaches must be inherently interdisciplinary, including geochemistry, geophysics, geology, hydrothermal systems, and biology. The place of the ocean ridge system within the overall Earth system will be emphasized.
