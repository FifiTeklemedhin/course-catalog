Students may take both Economics 1123 and Statistics 139 for credit. However, Statistics 139 will not count as the econometrics requirement for the economics concentration. Also, Economics 1123 may not be taken for credit if taken after Economics 1126, but credit will be given for both courses if Economics 1123 is taken first. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
Statistics 100 and 104.
