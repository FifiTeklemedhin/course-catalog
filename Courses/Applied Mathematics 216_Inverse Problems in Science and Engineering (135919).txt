          Many problems in science and engineering are inverse problems. For example, an experimental result that requires an explanation can be couched thus - given the data, what is the theory/model that provides it - this is an inverse problem. In engineering, a given function (in a product/software .... ) requires a design - again an inverse problem. In this course, we will first spend some time on characterizing common features of inverse problems from science and engineering - from oil prospecting and seismology to cognitive science, from particle physics to engineering design, then introduce deterministic and probabilistic methods for their solution, and finally deploy them computationally on real questions drawn from the sciences and engineering.
Recommended Prep: Linear algebra, Differential equations, Basic probability, some MATLAB experience.
