         Stat 213 will build upon Stat 211 and give some tools to study and validate statistical methods (asymptotic statistics, well-specified and mis-specified models, model comparison, cross-validation, bootstrap). These concepts will be discussed in the context of advanced statistical models: non-parametric regression, regularized regression, latent variable and hidden Markov models. Numerical methods required to put such models into practice will be discussed.
