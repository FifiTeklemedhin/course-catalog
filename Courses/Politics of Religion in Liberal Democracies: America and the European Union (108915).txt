This course examines the various ways, normative and practical, in which politics interact with religion in the U.S. and select EU-member countries. Structuring it are three main tasks: to examine the utility of secularization theory in explaining changes on the political landscape; to compare and contrast American and European experiences with religion in the public sphere; and to consider the political implications of increasing religious/ideological pluralism within these societies.
