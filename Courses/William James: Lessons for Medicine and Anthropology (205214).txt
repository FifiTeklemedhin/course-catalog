William James: Lessons for Medicine and Anthropology (205214)
Arthur Kleinman Omar Haque
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course is a close reading of the works of William James for students of anthropology and the social sciences who have an interest in healthcare and medicine. Although William James was a great Harvard philosopher and psychologist, his only formal training was as a physician. James's ideas have deeply influenced the social sciences and humanities, yet have rarely reflected in a systematic manner back to medicine, medical anthropology, and the medical humanities. This course therefore considers how James's pragmatist and radical empiricist ideas about knowledge and practice, experience, the self (emotion and reason, will and habit, consciousness and embodiment), evidence and belief, pluralism and truth, hope and tragedy, suffering and meaning, and moral responsibility and social amelioration could inform understanding and practice in medicine, anthropology, illness experience, and caregiving. Weekly readings will be supplemented with literature, film, or other artistic media to highlight James's life and ideas and their relevance to medicine and anthropology. Open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates.
