 Social Sciences
         At the macro level, schools are embedded in larger historical and social contexts, including liberalism, modernity, globalization, citizenship, and nationalism. At the micro-level, schools themselves comprise important cultural dynamics. This course examines schools at both levels to explore: Are schools sites of social stasis or social transformation? Do they create conditions of emancipation or do they further projects of subordination? What is 'learnt' in schools beyond the stated objectives of educationists? What are the promises and limitations of social theory and ethnographic research for educational practice and policy? We will explore these questions by drawing on studies on various dimensions of education, based both in the United States and abroad.
