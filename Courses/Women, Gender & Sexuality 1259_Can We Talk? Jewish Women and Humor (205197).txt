         This course will examine the traditions of humor in Jewish women's writing and performance. We will be looking at questions such as: What is Jewish humor? What is feminist humor? How have Jewish women influenced American popular culture? What is the relationship between Jewish male humor and Jewish female humor? How do cultural stereotypes function? What is the role of anger in humor â€“especially women's humor? We will examine how Jewish humor, and specifically, Jewish women's humor, is the basis for much of what we call "American humor" today.
We will be reading, listening to, and watching a wide range of materials. Readings will include performance theory, humor theory, sociology of American popular culture, Jewish American history, the sociology of immigration and gender roles, essays on Jewish humor, feminist humor, as well as writings by Dorothy Parker, Gertrude Berg, Grace
