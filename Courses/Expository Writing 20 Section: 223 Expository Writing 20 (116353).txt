Faking It to Make It

Between 2002 and 2005, serial impostor Esther Reed took classes in the Harvard Extension School and participated in the university's debate team under the name Natalie Bowman. She later posed as an honors student at Columbia University. A similar deception took place at Princeton in the early 1990s when Alexi Indris-Santana, track team and Ivy Club member, was revealed to be a 31-year-old impostor named James Hogue. Reed's and Hogue's ability to pass as students at prestigious universities raises questions about the relationship between lying, success, and cultural standards. How do lies inform the ways we think about ourselves? What is the appeal of living one's life as a masquerade or performance? In a world where technology increasingly blurs the lines between life and fiction, is deception ever justified? This course examines the ways deception impacts our lives and shapes our sense of self at a time when notions of what is real and what is fake are increasingly being called into question. We begin by analyzing the role of rumors and storytelling in The Great Gatsby, where F. Scott Fitzgerald reshapes our understanding of the confidence man by turning him into a cultural icon. Then, we examine the ethics and morality of deception by testing Friedrich Nietzsche's and Sigmund Freud's notions of truth against films such as Chicago, Quiz Show, and The Prestige. In our final unit, students will have the opportunity to research an instance of imposture in contemporary culture or fiction and make an argument that interprets and assesses its significance. Sample topics include hoaxes such as Orson Welles' The War of the Worlds broadcast, the creation of fake online identities for "catfishing" the unsuspecting, and race, class, and gender passing.

Humans, Nature, and the Enviro
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Deforestation, overpopulation, pesticide use, toxic oceans, endangered species, global warming. How are we to make sense of the many environmental problems facing the Earth today? Although the sciences provide a factual account of environmental threats and ways of countering them, scientific facts seem not to be enough, since artists, writers, filmmakers, and even scientists find themselves turning again and again to their imaginations to respond to the environmental predicaments of industrial society. They may be doing what English Romantic poet Percy Shelley powerfully described 200 years ago as an essentially human and creative impulse: "to imagine that which we know." How, then, have creative minds imagined –in essays, books, and movies –the very idea of nature, the place of humans in it, and their power to change the environment? In this course, we will consider both the possibilities and the problems that writers and filmmakers have imagined about human interactions with the natural world. We begin with the nineteenth century, when Romantic writers were urgently contemplating the meaning of nature in an age of increasing industrialization. In the first unit we interpret "Walking" (1862), the naturalist Henry David Thoreau's seminal nature essay that imaginatively explores the concept of wildness. In the second unit we will critically compare the literary approaches of two popular books by scientists –Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), and James Lovelock's The Revenge of Gaia (2006). And in the final unit we will examine the techniques of documentary movies about relationships between humans and animals –Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man (2005) in which the filmmaker takes issue with the self-proclaimed environmentalist Timothy Treadwell who strove to protect bears in the Alaskan wilderness, and Gabriela Cowperthwaite's Blackfish (2013) in which she delivers a brilliant polemic against the Sea World corporation and its treatment of captive killer whales.
