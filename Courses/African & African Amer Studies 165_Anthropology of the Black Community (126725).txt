This reading seminar examines anthropological theory, descriptions and research about practices of African American culture as well as African-diasporic identities. This course will also consider previous, recent and future debates within anthropology about African American communities and culture. The focus will be on institutions like family, the church, organizations, practices such as play, performance and the arts and social and political issues of black identity and racism. Among the topics we will address are: the black community, language and discourse, religion, social and cultural beliefs and practices, education, gender and sexuality, humor and satire and music. This course is meant to consider how popular culture, the social sciences, linguistics and socio-cultural anthropology have tried to understand and represent the complex and changing African American culture.
