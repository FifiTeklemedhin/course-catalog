This course will examine the complex disconnections and intersections between studies of race, gender, sexuality and disability. Why are disabled people so often represented in the popular media as sexless, innocent, and childlike? Why are the few portrayals we do see of disabled people in relationships heterosexual, white, and cis- gendered?. Topics include: shifting definitions of disability and mental illness in relation to sexuality; fetish and desire; vulnerability and violence; the role of technology as cure; neurodiversity; disability art; the media's role in shaping cultural perceptions of disabled people's desires and pleasures; Mad pride and LGBT pride; queer and crip theory; politics and liberation.
