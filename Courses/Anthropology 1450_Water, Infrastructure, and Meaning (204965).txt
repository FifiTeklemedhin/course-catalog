This course will show the usefulness of anthropology, conceptually and methodologically, for understanding water consumption and management in past and contemporary societies, especially those undergoing water stress. Topics include cultural notions and values of water, the hydrology and technologies of water purification and conservation, irrigation and the state, big dams controversies, water as a "right" and water as a "commodity," and local, national and international water management schemes. Case studies are drawn from around the world. Though social anthropology and archaeology are the main disciplines upon which the course draws, it will also engage developmental economics, geography, political ecology, history, and water sciences such as conservation and engineering.
