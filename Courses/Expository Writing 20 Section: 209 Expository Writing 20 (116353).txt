American West actually like, and how did we get these ideas? The cowboy has occupied a central place in the American imagination for three centuries, but the truth of the West has often been at odds with its written history. Chinese massacres, Indian boarding schools, and struggling homesteaders were as much a part of the historical West as horses and cattle. We will begin the course by lifting the veil of myth about the West: we will read first- hand accounts of the 19th century West from the people who lived there, focusing on those who are often left out of Wild West stories. With a better grasp of the historical West, we will try to untangle the roots of the American fascination with cowboy stories. At the turn of the 20th century, Americans built a powerful mythology around Western life. Looking to 19th century ideas of manhood, race and urban living, we will ask why the Wild West was invented, and for whom? Who read and spread stories of the cowboy? Finally, we will investigate the cowboy's legacy by analyzing Western films. Cowboy myths cast a long shadow over the 20th and 21st centuries, but their interpretation has changed over time. By watching classic and modern Westerns, we will explore why Americans, when looking for answer to difficult questions, still go West.

that fascinate our pop culture. On the screen, they come to life as horrifying alternate universes and dead civilizations—the very fates we must avoid at all costs. And yet wastelands are not exclusively the stuff of science fiction. In this course, we will grapple with both imaginary and actual wastelands. We will begin with short stories by Jack London, Thomas King, and Octavia Butler. From the icy wilds of the Yukon to the borderlands of Native American exile, these writers question the way wastelands have been imagined, especially in North America, over the past century. Next, we will turn to real wastelands—to the garbage dumps and arid landscapes where nothing grows. We will ask what these places reveal about their inhabitants, their struggles, and their achievements. Finally, students will research a wasteland of their own choosing—anything from the mega slums of Mumbai to the sprawl of Boston's unused rooftops. Along the way, we will investigate how wastelands form and evolve, and how people adapt to them. Are wastelands actually the places we should avoid at all costs, or are they the places we can no longer afford to ignore?

Respectable Ladies, Rebellious
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's

Class Notes:
Modern Americans typically view the idea of being "ladylike"—a notion of womanhood as bound up in respectability—as something restrictive, even
demeaning. For a woman to be "ladylike," after all, often means she is relegated to a corner where she will not be assertive and empowered. But for centuries, women fought and died to be allowed that reputation. Being a "respectable" woman meant being fully human –and fully protected—and then over time that identity became a shackle to break free of. This course will examine the curious history of "respectable" womanhood to see what happened to those women who battled to be valued, sometimes for the most fundamental human status, and sometimes for the right to cross the bounds of propriety. What were the real risks of walking the line of respectable and unladylike and the dangers of stepping outside the lines? While modern feminism fights against restrictive stereotypes, why did some women fight to keep them? This course consists of three units, each focusing on a different moment in American history. We will begin with women who lost their lives when their neighbors began to question whether they really were "women" at all –the Salem witches. Using close reading skills we will sift through historical documents to understand just how the people of Salem were willing to decide some of their own daughters were not really human after all. Next we will move forward two centuries to read the fascinating memoir of anti-lynching crusader Ida B Wells, a woman who once travelled for two days to protect her reputation against slander. We will learn about race and womanhood in the late 19th century to understand why in order to be a reformer, Wells had to be a lady first. Finally, we will take on a research project on iconic 20th-century figures from Civil Rights lawyer Pauli Murray to Hillary Clinton, women who found themselves caught between being ladies and being leaders. Throughout we will examine how racial and sexual stereotypes posed not only challenges but also unexpected opportunities for rebels and reformers. What power does being a lady hold, and what boundaries does it create? What does it mean, both yesterday and today, to be not just female, but a woman?
