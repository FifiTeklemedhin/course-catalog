Translation makes culture possible. Individual writers and thinkers draw sustenance and stimulation from works created outside their own cultures, and artists working in one format get ideas from those working in entirely different media. Translation between languages and between art forms will center our seminar's work. Taking a broad view of translation as a mental activity, we will study poems, fiction, film, photography, and music. We will stretch our own imaginative capacities by transposing material across media and genres, creating homophonic translations, and translating between languages. We will work individually as well as collaboratively. We will read a small amount translation theory, and some reflections by working translators. We will invite into our classroom a few practicing poets, artists, and translators and attend poetry readings and lectures at Harvard. The only requirement is some knowledge of a language besides English –and a readiness to play with languages, art forms, and texts. Readings from Kazim Ali, Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Joseph Brodsky, Anne Carson, Emily Dickinson, Forrest Gander, Susan Howe, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Velimir Khlebnikov, Vladimir Nabokov, Sappho, W. G. Sebald, Tracy K. Smith, Marina Tsvetaeva, Wang Wei, and the Bible; music by John Adams, David Grubbs, and others; artwork by Peter Sacks. Films to include Despair and The Golem.
