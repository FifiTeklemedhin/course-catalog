In this course we explore German literature from the Wendezeit to the present. We investigate the central cultural, political and technological developments that have shaped the millennial consciousness since 1989/1990, focusing particularly on the question of how literary texts navigate the increasing tension between real and virtual worlds, or

between bodies and media. Topics include: Wendeliteratur, dystopia, 9/11, terrorism, populism, immunity, body poetics, medicine/anatomy, intermediality, interculturality, virtuality, Popliteratur. We read canonical contemporary authors such as Draesner, Grünbein, Kracht, Jelinek, and Tawada. But we also read young authors whose role in contemporary literature is not as clearly defined yet. We thus take an active role in the canon-making process, discussing what incites readers and makes any particular text popular in the 21st century.
