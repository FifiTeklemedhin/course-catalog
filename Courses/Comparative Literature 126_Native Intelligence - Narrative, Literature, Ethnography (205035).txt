Native Intelligence - Narrative, Literature, Ethnography (205035)
Roanne Kantor
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Ethnography and literary fiction share a common interest in the narrative form. Yet the disciplines of anthropology and literary study understand the place of narratives within their fields in strikingly dissimilar ways, and use very different tools when analyzing them. Moreover, since the history of Anthropology and Literature as academic disciplines are both tainted by their relationship to European colonization, they have tended to regard each other with suspicion, as sources of "native intelligence" shoring up colonial power. This seminar examines narratives from around the world that cut across both disciplines. Readings focus on narratives and theories "on the edge" -- novelists writing ethnography, anthropologists (and other social scientists) reading fiction, and ethnographers (and historians) theorizing "narrative" more generally. This seminar raises questions about how these texts were created, and the methodologies used in each discipline to study them. What strategies do writers of ethnography and fiction use to represent groups of people that are culturally distinct from their primary audience? How do they create the feeling of reality in their texts, what literary scholars call "verisimilitude?" What different kinds of questions do literary scholars and anthropologists ask of the narratives in their respective fields, and when do they come into conflict?
