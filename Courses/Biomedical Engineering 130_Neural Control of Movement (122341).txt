Approaches from robotics, control theory, and neuroscience for understanding biological motor systems. Analytical and computational modeling of muscles, reflex arcs, and neural systems that contribute to motor control in the brain. Focus on understanding how the central nervous system plans and controls voluntary movement of the eyes and limbs. Learning and memory; effects of variability and noise on optimal motor planning and control in biological systems.
