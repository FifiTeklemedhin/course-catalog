Hiphop Theory & Philosophy: Black Comix & Imagining the Real World of Badass Superheroes (204503)
Marcyliena Morgan
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: T 1000 AM - 1159 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course examines the symbolic meaning of the black superhero and how novels, graphic comics, and film are influenced by the language ideology and symbolism of the social and political black imaginary. This imaginary is constructed through social, philosophical and theorizing analyses of social class, gender and sexuality, racism and bigotry as cultural practice in the black community in general and hiphop in particular. The course is meant to provide cultural and philosophical insight into present and futuristic representations of worlds that assume the presence of diverse and shifting communities and conflicts. In doing so, it addresses why superheroes require the African American designation of badass to defend. The course includes various media, readings, films, and guest speakers.
