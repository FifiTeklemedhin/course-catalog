W 0300 PM - 0459 PM n/a
This seminar will explore a core group of Broadway musicals. Historical, musical, and theatrical discussions will be paired with student performances and staging of individual scenes (done under the guidance of Allegra Libonati from the A.R.T. Institute). The seminar will touch on signal moments over the course of the "Golden Age" of the musical, stretching up to the present day: Oklahoma! (1943), South Pacific (1949), West Side Story (1957), A Chorus Line (1975), Wicked (2003), and In the Heights (2008). The class will attend a performance of Stephen Sondheim's A Little Night Music at Boston's Huntington Theatre. Blending historical study and hands-on practice, this seminar aims to offer a wide range of perspectives on the interpretation and performance of Broadway musicals.
