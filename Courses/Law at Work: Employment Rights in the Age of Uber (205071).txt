2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Work is what most of us do with most of our time. Even before we start a career, we invest our energy in preparing for work and in imagining what work life will be.

The seminar also will examine the way law polices the line between work and "life" by looking at the emerging right-to- disconnect. And the seminar will address the fundamental question of who exactly is an employee: do Uber drivers or college football players count? The seminar concludes with a discussion of the ways technological changes are transforming work and, with it, the law that governs this central feature of our lives.
