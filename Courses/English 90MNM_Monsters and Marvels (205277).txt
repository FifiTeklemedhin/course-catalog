A chain of medieval trade and pilgrimage routes stretched from Iceland to Indonesia, and distant lands were a subject of powerful fascination to medieval readers. How did medieval English writers and readers imagine the world? How did narratives of travel, conquest, pilgrimage, and exploration wrestle with questions of religious, ethnic, and cultural diversity, racial and national identity, and the limits of human knowledge? We examine medieval illuminations, illustrations, and maps alongside texts including the Crusade romance The King of Tars, the pilgrimage account of Margery Kempe, and the incredibly popular Book of John Mandeville.
