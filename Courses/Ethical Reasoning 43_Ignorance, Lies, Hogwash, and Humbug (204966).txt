 Ethical Reasoning
           We demand that our politicians tell us the truth and that our government be transparent. We expect policymakers to be knowledgeable and the public to be educated. We anticipate civil disagreements and depend on experts to inform our decisions. But are these demands, expectations, anticipations and dependencies reasonable? And how do we make sense of them in our current political climate? This course will examine the role of truth and knowledge in well-functioning democracies through the lenses of politics, philosophy, and behavioral psychology, putting these approaches in dialogue with each other with the aim of arriving at a more thorough understanding of the problems at hand, in the hopes of laying the foundation for more promising action on addressing them.
