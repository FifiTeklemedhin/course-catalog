Kimberley Patton
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 30
This comparative course will examine historical and contemporary traditions of primordial, cosmic, and sacred trees in religion, folklore, mythology, and ritual, including the ways in which the special natural characteristics of trees have been interpreted metaphorically and metaphysically. We will consider primary iconographic and textual evidence as well as secondary sources. Individual research projects in particular traditions will be featured. Note: This is a continuation of a fall-term course, HDS 3823a/FAS 1011a. It is not necessary to have taken the fall course to take the spring course; each of the two semesters is designed to stand alone. Enrollment limited to 30 with the permission of the instructor, by application at the first course meeting.
