This class explores the relationships of passion, love, and obligation that bound men and women over the course of nearly two millennia, from Rome in the first century B.C.E. to sixteenth-century Italy. In particular, it focuses on how those relationships were organized legally and institutionally, on the social roles created by such relationships, and on the connection (or lack thereof) between marriage, love, and sexual passion. Although marriage in the West long was viewed as an exclusively heterosexual estate, the course also considers how homosocial and homosexual desires have affected it throughout history.
