Scholars, educators, and journalists often use culture to explain differences in academic achievement by race-- sometimes insightfully and other times more clumsily. However, the evidence for cultural explanations is thin and difficult to assess. Cultural explanations for low achievement have sometimes been criticized as blaming children for their own low achievement, and for offering little to practitioners and policymakers on ways to reduce educational inequality. On the other hand, cultural explanations for high achievement frequently assume a model minority myth. This course addresses how and when culture can lead to ethnic and racial inequality in education, in order to facilitate a better understanding of how to reduce educational inequality. We will analyze differences between and within ethnic and racial groups. In addition to ethnic and racial cultures, the course addresses school culture, youth culture, popular culture, and cultural identities. Discussing solutions for reducing inequality will be an important component of this course. The course will be run as a seminar.
Class Notes: This course is jointly offered offered in the Graduate School of Education as EDU A133.
