This is an experiential learning course. The ensemble gives several concerts each year, sometimes joining with the chorus to perform large-scale works. Students are required to attend all rehearsals and certain special Saturday "retreats" announced in advance. Students are expected to practice the music outside the rehearsal time. Grades are based on attendance and participation.
