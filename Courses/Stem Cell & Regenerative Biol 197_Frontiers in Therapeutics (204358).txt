         How realistic are promises to "eliminate" diseases and to "personalize" medicine? This course looks at biological principles underlying therapeutics, ranging from those described first in Egyptian papyri to those under development today (using chemicals, proteins, cells, and genetic manipulations) and based on traditional philosophies and on science. As part of the class, students will have the opportunity to design novel approaches to diseases today without cure.
Course Notes: Prerequisites are Life and Physical Sciences A or Life Sciences 1a; Life Sciences 1b; MCB 60 or SCRB 20, or permission of the instructor
