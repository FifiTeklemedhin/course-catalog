Immigration is one of the most powerful forces in influencing the structure of societies, altering everything from educational and economic institutions to politics. Understanding the immigration process from a sociological perspective provides insight into why individuals and groups move, how they are received and incorporated into the host society, and the implications for the native-born and for those who stay behind. These theoretical issues will be explored through an examination of actual migration flows over time and around the world. Although the focus of the course will be on U.S. immigration, we will also spend some time on non-U.S. flows, including the current refugee crisis in Europe.
