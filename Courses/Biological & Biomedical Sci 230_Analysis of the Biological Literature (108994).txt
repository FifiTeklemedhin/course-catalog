Students participate in intensive small group discussions focused on the critical analysis of basic research papers from a wide range of fields including biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, genetics, and microbiology. Papers are discussed in terms of their background, significance, hypothesis, experimental methods, data quality, and interpretation of results. Students will be asked to propose future research directions, to generate new hypotheses and to design experiments aimed at testing them. For the midterm exam, the students will have to submit written critiques of recent papers from the literature, with an emphasis on proposing new experimental directions to test the models proposed in the papers.
Course Notes: This course is required for first year BBS students, and is open only to BBS students.
