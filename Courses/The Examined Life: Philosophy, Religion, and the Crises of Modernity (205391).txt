An interrogation into how to reflect and act in view of the changing state of our knowledge and self-understanding in a modern world and pluralistic, democratic society. Readings will focus on selected major modern philosophical figures from the American and continental contexts, such as Emerson, Royce, Du Bois, Whitehead, Arendt, Gadamer and Levinas. Questions considered will include the human condition, the divine, the nature of evil, and how to think about the religious in light of the advance of scientific and technological methods of inquiry.
