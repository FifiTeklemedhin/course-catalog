Sex and the Brain (205099)
2017 Fall (2 Credits) Schedule: R 0630 PM - 0759 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
Animals exhibit many innate, sex-specific behaviors that provide useful models to study the underlying neural circuits, and sex differences in the nervous system also have important implications for human health. Through discussions, activities, and lectures, this course introduces students to various aspects of sexually dimorphic neural circuits across modelorganisms, while emphasizing critical thinking and effective science communication.
