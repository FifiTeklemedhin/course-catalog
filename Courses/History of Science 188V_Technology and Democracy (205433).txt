         Digital technologies shape –in ways both visible and obscure –many aspects of contemporary governance and democracy. As citizens, it is imperative that we understand how legislative and juridical concepts are built into these technologies, as well as how these technologies in turn impact contemporary uses and abuses of justice, privacy, surveillance, and representation. Beginning with the use of punch-cards to manage census data, this course tours the intersections of digital technology and American politics. Topics will include voting machines, hacktivism, the Snowden Affair, redistricting and Congressional apportionment, statistical uses of polling data, the relation of national security to information privacy, as well as CCTV cameras, social networking, and algorithmic thinking.
