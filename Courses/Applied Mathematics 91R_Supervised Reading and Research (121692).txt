2018 Spring (4 Credits)
Instructor Permissions: Instructor
Schedule: TBD Enrollment Cap: n/a
Mathematics 1b is a prerequisite, although it can be taken concurrently. Some limited concepts from Mathematics 21a / Applied Mathematics 21a will be used, but they can be learned during the course. The course provides an introduction to programming with a mathematical focus, and starts from the level of a complete beginner; in the past, some students have found Computer Science 50 helpful, although this is not required.

         An individual project of guided reading and research culminating in a substantial paper or other piece of work which can be meaningfully evaluated to assign a letter grade; may not be taken on a PA/FL basis. Students engaged in preparation of a senior thesis ordinarily should take Applied Mathematics 99r instead.
Course Notes:
Additional Course Attributes:
May be taken as a half course in either term; normally may not be taken for more than two terms. Applications may be obtained at Pierce Hall 110. Students should consult their advisers and concentration literature for further information and guidance. Applications must be signed by the student, by the faculty member supervising the project (who will recommend the grade), and by the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who will sign the student's study card once the project and its method of evaluation have been approved.
