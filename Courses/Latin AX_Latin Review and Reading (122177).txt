         Latin Ax is designed for students who have studied some Latin prior to enrollment at Harvard. Participants will review and consolidate their knowledge of Latin grammar and apply that knowledge to the reading of short classical texts, both literary and non-literary (such as inscriptions). Students should leave the course able to read with the precision that is necessary to use primary sources in research.
