         The course will cover the isometric embedding problem in all its forms, including the contributions of Weyl, Cartan, Nash, Kuiper, Nirenberg, and Gromov. This will include lengthy digressions into some of the pieces of mathematics originally inspired by isometric embedding, including the Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, convex integration, and pseudoholomorphic curves. We will also cover the modern application of isometric embedding to measuring
