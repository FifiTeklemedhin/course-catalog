Large portions of the Latin Bible were translated into Old English in the centuries before 1066. Some efforts, like that of Aelfric (10th century), were cautious and painstakingly literal because of the anxiety associated with any departure from the Latin text. Others, moved with interpretative freedom, especially those that exploited the conventions of Old English poetry, so that Moses, for example, leads his people across a desert that resembles the forests of northern Europe, and Satan is a rebel warrior chieftain.
