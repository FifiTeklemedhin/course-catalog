         The history of energy is the history of modern political economy. The history of energy is the history of a scientific concept and its technological application. The history of energy is the history of climate change and environmental catastrophe. The history of energy is the history of life, the universe, and everything. All of these statements are true. This seminar is a critical introduction to the roles that energy has played in history and historiography. Using this ubiquitous and fundamental concept, we will explore questions ranging from climate change and capitalism to causality and colonialism in diverse places and times.
