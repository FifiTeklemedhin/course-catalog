2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap:
M 0830 AM - 1059 AM n/a
In this course, the student is introduced to micro-fabrication techniques through the filter of the rapidly emerging, multi-disciplinary and exciting field of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS.) It is a lab based course complemented by mandatory weekly lectures. It teaches fundamentals of micro machining and fabrication techniques, including planar thin-film process technologies, photolithography and soft-lithography techniques, deposition and etching techniques as well as limited inspection and characterization technologies. Students, in teams, will build and characterize fully functional: surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators, micro polymerized chain reaction (uPCR) amplifiers, micro pressure sensors and final projects of their own choosing. In doing so, they will be exposed to the basic principles of tools in an advanced cleanroom.
Course Notes: Labs to be determined.
Recommended Prep: Applied Physics 50a,b, Physical Sciences 12a,b, or 15a,b; College Chemistry at the level of Life Sciences 1a, Physical Sciences 1, Engineering
