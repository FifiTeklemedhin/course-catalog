A crowning achievement of 20th century science, quantum mechanics is also bizarre enough to lead intelligent people to claim that the universe perpetually splits into many copies of itself, that conscious minds can make physical systems "jump" unpredictably, that classical logic must be revised, that there is no objective reality, and much, much more. We will separate the wheat of genuine mystery from the chaff of philosophical confusion. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics required.
