 Primarily for Undergraduate Students
         An applications course highlighting the use of computers in solving scientific problems. Students will be exposed to fundamental computer science concepts such as computer architectures, data structures, algorithms, and parallel computing. Fundamentals of scientific computing including abstract thinking, algorithmic development, and assessment of computational approaches. Students will learn to use open source tools and libraries and apply them to data analysis, modeling, and visualization of real scientific problems. Emphasizes parallel programming and "parallel thinking."
Students are expected to have programming experience (e.g., CS50/51, fluent in Python, C/C++, or similar). Course will be taught primarily in Python and C.
