The Embedded Teaching Practicum aims to enhance the teaching experience for TAs and the learning experience for enrollees in the core BBS courses. While TAs serve different functions and experience teaching from different perspectives in each of our core courses, they collectively serve a vital role in helping with the delivery a contemporary, high quality and accessible education to HMS graduate students. The embedded teaching practicum provides practice-based training in facilitating a group discussion; professionalism in the classroom; curriculum design, course evaluation, assessment development and DBER; and preparation for teaching throughout and beyond time in graduate school. Teaching assistants are provided training and experience in the development of an early-career teaching philosophy.
