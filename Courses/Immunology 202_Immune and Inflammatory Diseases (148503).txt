IMM202 builds on IMM201 and explores fundamental principles of immunology in the context of immune and inflammatory diseases. Through a series of lectures and discussion, students will survey a broad range of diseases in which the immune system is essential. Topics will include not only diseases that mobilize classical immunity but also conditions to which we now know the immune systems contributes. Students will use oral and written exercises to learn how to evaluate and synthesize major concepts and tools germane to immunology's relationship to bioscience.
