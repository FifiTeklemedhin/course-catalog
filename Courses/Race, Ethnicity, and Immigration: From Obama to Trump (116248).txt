The American racial, ethnic, and immigration orders have been changing at a dizzying pace over the past decade, from the extraordinary election of a liberal African American president in 2008 to the very different, but equally extraordinary, election of a conservative populist president in 2016. These changes emerged from a broad and deep set of transformations in American group dynamics over the past half-century. This course examines what has gotten better, and worse, in the ways that the United States engages with group hierarchy, discrimination, incorporation, and political activity since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. It also examines why these changes have occurred, and how we might predict, and affect, how race, ethnicity, and migration will be further transformed in the foreseeable future.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.
