              Part two of a two-part intermediate course in modern Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian (BCS) language and culture for students with previous study of the language. Further development of vocabulary and oral expression within a comprehensive review of BCS grammar. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed as students learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research. Systematic study of word formation and other strategies are taught to help free students from excessive dependence on the dictionary and develop confidence in reading.
The two-part course prepares students for continued study of BCS in advanced-level courses and for study or travel abroad.
