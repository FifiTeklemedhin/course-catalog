 This course will provide a broad overview of Greek history and culture from the Bronze Age through the Hellenistic period. We will survey major political, social, and cultural transformations, as well as major achievements in literature, material culture, and philosophy. Students will acquire familiarity with a wide variety of primary sources (all read in translation), key examples of Greek art and architecture, and selected secondary literature as they learn to appreciate a civilization that is considerably stranger and more complex than the image conveyed by modern commonplaces about "the Greeks."
