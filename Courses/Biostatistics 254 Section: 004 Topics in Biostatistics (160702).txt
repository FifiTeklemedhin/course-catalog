This course will be organized partly as a seminar and partly as a practicum, in order to allow students to conceptualize and design a biostatistical research project, to craft effective research and grant proposals, and to develop skills for providing constructive critiques of the research proposals of other students and colleagues. During each week, the first session will be given seminar style but may also include case discussions or guest lecturers. The second session of each week will be devoted to meeting in smaller subgroups of 2-3 students to share, discuss, and provide feedback on grant or research proposals.
