How do we know ourselves? Traditional definitions of the self have been founded on family, gender, race, religion, nationality. We'll read a number of texts from the 19th-21st centuries that pose questions and complicate answers to questions of identity. Readings include works by Claire de Duras, Balzac, George Sand, Merimee, Colette, Nothomb, and LeClezio.
