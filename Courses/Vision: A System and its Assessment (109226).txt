This course provides an introduction to the visual system and its assessment. In general, we will consider vision as a system rather than its low-level components. Each two-hour session consists of two lectures provided by faculty with expertise in that area. Topics will include basic science and clinical topics, normal vision and abnormal vision, methods of assessment of animals and humans, clinical and laboratory measures.
Class Notes: Classes begin on September 13, 2017 through November 15, 2017. Classes will be held on the 2nd floor conference room, Schepens Eye Research
Institute.
