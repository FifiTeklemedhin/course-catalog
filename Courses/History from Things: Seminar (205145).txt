This seminar focuses on the use of material culture as a primary source for constructing historical narratives that access aspects of the past not covered by written words. We will look closely at how materiality theory relates to the methodologies and conceptual categories used by historians to understand the past. Students will also be trained in the specific skills needed for interpreting material sources. Because material history relies on methodologies and theoretical approaches that transcend the fields that define our discipline, the course's coverage will be broad across both time and space, allowing for participants to explore corpora of materials according to their own interests and expertise.
