         This course provides offers an intensive examination of the history of Jews in the modern German Kulturbereich â€“ that swath of Europe where German was the sole, or a primary, language of political administration, education, communication, and high culture. Covering the period from the eighteenth through mid-twentieth centuries, we will explore the meaning of Germanness to Jews and of Jews to German Christians. Among the topics to be explored are debates over Jewish emancipation, Jewish struggles with religious and secular identities, processes of acculturation and integration, antisemitism and Jewish responses, economic and family life, Jewish culture in the German empire and Dual Monarchy and in the post-1918 German and Austrian republics, and the fate of the Jews in Nazi Germany and its annexed territories.
