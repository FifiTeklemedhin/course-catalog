         This undergraduate seminar explores the history of race and nation in Latin America, from the wars of independence in the 19th century to the present. Drawing on a range of educational material, this seminar promotes a critical understanding of how the idea of race operates throughout Latin America and the ways in which race intersects with nation building and the concept of national identity. Themes covered include: the tension between "nation" and "state"; mestizaje and other national mythologies of inclusion and exclusion; scientific racism; identity politics; the intersection of race, class and gender; and the rise of transnational racial identities.
