          Abstract elementary classes are a kind of concrete categories with all directed colimits whose morphisms are monomorphisms. They generalize the model theory of classes axiomatized by a first-order theory or certain infinitary logics, and encompass many algebraic classes of objects such as valued fields or locally finite groups. A presentation of both basic model-theoretic results (the presentation theorem, model-homogeneous is saturated, closure under infinitary elementary equivalence) and generalizations of stability theory to this setup, with a focus on free (nonforking) amalgamation (generalizing linear independence of vector spaces and algebraic independence in fields).
