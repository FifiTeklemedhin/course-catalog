         This course will begin with a basic introduction to DNA, genes, and genomes for students with no biology background. We will then introduce cancer as an evolutionary process and review landmarks in the history of cancer genetics. We will then discuss the basics of sequencing technology and modern NGS. We will cover the main steps involved in turning billions of short sequencing reads into a representation of the somatic genetic alterations characterizing an individual patient's cancer. We will build on this foundation to study topics related to identifying mutations under positive selection from multiple tumors sampled in a population.
Recommended Prep: To accommodate both statistics students with little biology background as well as biology students with little data analysis background, we will allow
biology and statistics students to work as pairs to complete the homeworks HARVARD UNIVERSITY 9/4/2017 0:39 AM
and final project. These assignments will require basic programming and data manipulation ability in a statistical scripting language such as R (http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/rtc/event/introduction-r). In addition, basic knowledge of probability and statistical inference are encouraged.
