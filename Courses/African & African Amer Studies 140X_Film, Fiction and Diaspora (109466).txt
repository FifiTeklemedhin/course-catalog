         This course will explore important works of film and fiction on the African diasporas in the Americas and the Caribbean. Since diaspora unfolds in waves that include both very old and very recent immigrant populations, we will explore both classic and contemporary films and novels with regard to this separation and connection between old and new diasporas. Moreover, our explorations will extend to diverse national and cultural spaces of the African diaspora â€“Hispanic, French/Creole and English. A special feature of the course is an introduction - in the form of homage and celebration - to classic works of cinema and fiction on the African diaspora that have almost been forgotten. Finally, we will examine differences and similarities between the experience of diaspora in earlier times and in the new millennium.
