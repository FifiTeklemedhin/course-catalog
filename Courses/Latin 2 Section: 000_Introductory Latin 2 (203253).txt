Latin 2 Section: 000
Introductory Latin 2 (203253)
Ivy Livingston
Students wishing to continue after Latin 1x should proceed to Latin 2x, which completes the accelerated introductory sequence and prepares students for Latin 10.
No auditors. May be taken Pass/Fail.
None, but since 1x is an intensive course, students should feel confident of their ability to learn a highly inflected language relatively quickly, taking into account the demands of other commitments. Students with a little prior experience may take Latin 1x with the permission of the course head.
