         This course examines how researchers have analyzed observational, interview, and textual data in the study of social networks. We will explore both classic and contemporary readings in anthropology, sociology, history, and other disciplines, and study both traditional and new techniques, including those based on large-n data but focused on meaning and qualitative aspects of the social world. Social Network Analysis or a similar course on SNA methods is strongly recommended but not required.
Course Notes: Sociology concentrators in their senior year may take the course with prior permission from Instructor.
