       Investigates major landmarks in the development of allegorization and allegorical literary composition in European tradition. Starting with pseudo-Herakleitos and his allegorical hermeneutics of the Homeric epics, this seminar will study different theoretical explorations and literary manifestations of allegorical discourse from antiquity to modernity - from ancient Greek rhetoric to Prudentius to Byzantine literature to Dante to the Romantics to C. P. Cavafy to Benjamin and de Man. Topics to be addressed include: personification, ambiguity, hermeneutic double- tonguedness (amphoteroglosia), the interplay between allegory and other tropes and discursive modes (metaphor, metonymy, symbol, parody, satire).
