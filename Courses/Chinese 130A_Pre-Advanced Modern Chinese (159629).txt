The aim of this course is to further develop students' Chinese proficiency in both spoken and written language. By reading texts based on current issues and cultural phenomena and engaging in in-depth class discussions, students will continue to expand their vocabulary, master more complex grammatical structures, and develop an ability to perform tasks involving description, narration, and argumentation at the discourse level.
