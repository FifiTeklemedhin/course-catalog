This issue-driven course introduces students to historical art and visual culture of various styles, genres, and media and the pressing political, social, and cultural debates which inform Art History. Eschewing assumed universal consensus, students will engage with the intersection of national, racial, gender, sexual, and cultural identity and create a more inclusive narrative by examining the possibilities and limits of sex, gender, and racial identities for artistic production, representation, and exhibition. Decentering dominant US centric histories of art, we will use Canadian art as a case study, paying special attention to the experiences and production of Canadian women artists and the representation of female subjects in Canadian art. We will work to uncover legacies of cultural and racial diversity which are often suppressed by Eurocentric, romanticized narratives of British and French nation- building, and which obscure the artistic contributions of Indigenous peoples, women, and people of color.
