Beyond Neurons: The Role of Glia in Brain Function and Dysfunction (205098)
2017 Fall (2 Credits) Schedule: T 0600 PM - 0729 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
The study of glia cells will be approached from the context of their role in disease as a means to better understand their important function in the brain. We will compare and contrast the various types of glia cells and their roles in the healthy brain as well as in various neurological and psychiatric diseases with an emphasis on neuroimmunology in particular. We will draw from primary literature in both basic sciences and translational medicine. Students will evaluate and critique contemporary scientific claims about glia cells informally in class discussions as well as formally during journal club presentations, both of which are important skills used every day byscientists. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to explain themultifaceted roles of glia in the central nervous system.
