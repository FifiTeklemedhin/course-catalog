Studies Dante's Comedy as an enduring work of poetry, a major text of the European literary tradition, and the most comprehensive synthesis of medieval culture.Primarily based on textual analysis, the course looks at how literature works in relation to, on the one hand, the language and rhetorical tradition in which it is expressed and, on the other, the culture which it expresses and interprets. Particular attention is paid to the poem's central philosophical concerns, from the role of the individual in history and society to the relationship between progress and happiness, and between religion and morality.
Course Notes: Conducted in English. This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the
