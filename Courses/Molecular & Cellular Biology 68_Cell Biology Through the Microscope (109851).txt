MCB 68 explores three fundamental fields of eukaryotic cell biology: chromosome segregation, cell motility, and neuroscience. Each topic is approached from a historic and technical perspective. Students will discover these systems as the scientific field did, learning how each successive advance in microscopy revealed new biological details. Students will come away with a theoretical and hands-on understanding of microscopy as well as a grasp of the biological findings each technology revealed.
Recommended Prep: An additional introductory course in biology (e.g., MCB 60, MCB 80 or SCRB10) is recommended but not required. The course design, level, and
content is best suited for students in their sophomore year
