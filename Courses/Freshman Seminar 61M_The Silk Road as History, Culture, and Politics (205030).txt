Freshman Seminar 61M
The Silk Road as History, Culture, and Politics (205030)
Mark Elliott
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
In 1923, Harvard's Fogg Museum of Art sought to add to its collections by sending Langdon Warner, the University's first professor of Asian art, on an expedition to gather objects from the fabled Silk Road â€“objects that are part of the
Museum's permanent display even today. With this connection as a jumping-off point, the course will explore the history of the ancient trading routes linking East and West and the ways in which different Silk Road narratives have served as cultural and political capital around the world. Warner was in fact following in the footsteps of numerous other Westerners, who had for fifty years been investigating the geography, history, and languages of greater Turkestan (i.e., Central Asia). Who were these men, what drove their curiosity, what did they find, and where is it now? How did the "Silk Road" that they brought into existence come to be such an important part of the popular imagination of the ancient world, and of the ongoing re-imagination of modern geopolitics? In examining these questions, students will learn the skills needed for archival research, get a first-hand introduction to museum preservation, and study current attitudes toward cultural patrimony.
Course Notes: Students are required to participate in two class excursions, one to the Harvard Art Museum and another to the Museum of Fine Arts. There will
also be two required evening film screenings.
