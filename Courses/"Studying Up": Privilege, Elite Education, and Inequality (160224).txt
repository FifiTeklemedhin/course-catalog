Privilege is an understudied but important topic in educational and social science research. Recent scholarship increasingly attends to the role that elite educational institutions play in producing and maintaining social and economic inequalities. In this course, we will investigate the connections between class, privilege, and educational advantage. By employing the lens of cultural sociology, we will explore various contexts for elite education, the cultural practices around which they are organized, and the ways in which individuals negotiate a sense of legitimacy and identity within these spaces.
