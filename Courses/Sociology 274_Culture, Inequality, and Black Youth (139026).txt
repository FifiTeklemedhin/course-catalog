          The seminar examines the complex situation of black youth in America with an emphasis on the matrix of cultures that support, enrich and, in conjunction with racial and structural forces, undermine their life chances. We will attempt to unravel the sociological puzzle of the socio-economic disconnection, hyper-segregation, violence, gender conflicts, familial fragility, and high incarceration rate that beset a significant minority of them, on the one hand, and, on the other, their remarkable prominence and integration in the nation's popular culture. We tackle the complex and controversial problem of how best to understand, theoretically and pragmatically, the interactive role of culture in disentangling this conundrum. We conclude with a review of the best policies and practices aimed at improving their condition.
