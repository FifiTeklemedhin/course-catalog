 This is an introduction to Earth and Planetary science for EPS concentrators and an overview, for those outside the field, of the critical events and processes that have shaped the Earth's evolution and its place in the solar system. The course is designed to highlight the processes, from tectonic plate to microbial scale, that drive the Earth's response to (internal and external) perturbations and we will explore both the time scale of those perturbations and the limits of the Earth's resilience. By considering the full sweep of geological time, from the early Earth to the modern world, the course will take advantage of a series of natural experiments to compare the Earth system during periods with and without atmospheric oxygen, animals, land plants and polar ice sheets, and to compare it, on occasion, with other terrestrial planets.
Course Notes: Course includes a weekly two-hour lab (5 total during the term) and 3 one- day field trips.
Class Notes: Course includes four labs that will be spread out during term and a one-day field trip.
