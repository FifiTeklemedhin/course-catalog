Evan Hepler-Smith
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: M 0200 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 18
Our understanding of the relationship between humans and the environment has been forged in moments of crisis: natural and human-made disasters, technological failures, political disputes, scientific controversies. This course will address science, technology, and the environment in historical perspective through focused studies of environments in crisis, involving issues such as the pesticide DDT (the subject of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring), nuclear fallout, coal mining, extinction and endangered species, climate change, and toxic chemical leaks in India and the US. We will learn to sort out the complex dynamics of nature, knowledge, ethics, and power wrapped up in environmental crises, and how understandings of environmental crisis both shape and are shaped by specific social, cultural, and political contexts (including our own).
