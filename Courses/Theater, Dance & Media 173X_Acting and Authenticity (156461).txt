This studio-based seminar examines the concept of "building a character" and pushes it towards performance art. While acquiring Stanislavski- and Method-based acting techniques, students will also consider psychological realism in light of philosophical, psychological, sociological and scientific notions of authenticity and falsehood, presence, mimesis, identity, and empathy. What does it mean to turn into someone else? How total is the transformation? What are the implications for our understanding of the individual? What does "realist acting" mean in an era of of AI, social media, and motion capture? The seminar involves both readings and exercises, and culminates in a final project where participants turn into each other.
