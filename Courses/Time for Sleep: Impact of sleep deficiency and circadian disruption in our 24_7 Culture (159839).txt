America is a sleep‐starved nation. The Institute of Medicine estimates that between 50 and 70 million Americans are suffering from chronic sleep deficiency or sleep disorders, increasing their risk of weight gain, heart ailments, mood disorders, errors and catastrophic road accidents that kill more than 7,000 and maim more than 50,000 Americans annually. Children of all ages are sleeping about two hours less per night than they did in prior generations, rendering them hyperactive and irritable and compromising their ability to sustain attention and learn in school.

undervalue sleep and lionize all‐nighters, such that most patients with sleep disorders remain undiagnosed and untreated. This seminar will explore the function of sleep, the physiologic factors that regulate sleep and circadian rhythms, the impact of exposure to artificial light on sleep and circadian rhythms, historical and cultural differences in sleep habits, and the consequences of sleep deficiency, circadian disruption and sleep disorders on both the brain and the body. Public policy issues, such as school start times, limits on resident physician work hours, drowsy driving laws, and proposed regulations to screen transportation workers for sleep disorders will be debated. Students will be encouraged to track their own sleep patterns throughout the semester, identify the personal, structural and cultural barriers to maintaining healthy sleep while in college, and propose strategies to improve sleep health at Harvard College, the local community and the nation.
