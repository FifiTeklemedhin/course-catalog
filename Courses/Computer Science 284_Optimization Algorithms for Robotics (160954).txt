Numerical methods have revolutionized the way we control dynamic motions in complex robots. In this course, we study a variety of optimization algorithms for designing and stabilizing trajectories for walking, manipulating, and flying systems. Topics will include optimal control, nonlinear programming, trajectory planning and stabilization, model-predictive control, Lyapunov analysis via sums-of-squares programming, legged systems, and estimation and control through frictional contact. Students will gain practical experience implementing modern algorithms to control a variety of simulated systems using the Drake MATLAB software toolbox.
Recommended Prep: Linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Prior exposure to robotics and dynamics is helpful, but not required. Students will be expected to complete
significant programming assignments in MATLAB.
