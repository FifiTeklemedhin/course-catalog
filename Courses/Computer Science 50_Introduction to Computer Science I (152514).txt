Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. 68% of CS50 students have never taken CS before.
Class Notes:
This course meets on Fridays, 10am-12pm, starting September 1. The course also meets on one Wednesday, September 6, 1pm-2:30pm. Students without conflicts are encouraged to attend all lectures in person this year; students with conflicts may watch later online. Students may simultaneously enroll in CS50 and another course that meets at the same time. To do so, students should enroll in the other course via my.harvard.edu and then email enrollment@fas.harvard.edu to have CS50 manually added to their crimson carts as well. CS50 is ordinarily graded SAT/UNS, though students taking CS50 to fulfill old Gen Ed requirements or whose concentration requires letter grades should change their grading status to letter-graded via my.harvard by the term's fifth Monday. First years may take both CS50 and a freshman seminar SAT/UNS. All students are expected to attend an orientation meeting in Science Center D on either September 6, 5:30pm-6:30pm, or September 7, 3pm-4pm; students with conflicts may watch later online. See cs50.harvard.edu for FAQs. Required sections to be arranged. No final exam.
