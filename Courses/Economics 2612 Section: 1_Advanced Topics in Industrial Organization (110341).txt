This course will cover both theoretical and econometric tools that are being used to explore more appropriate ways of analyzing market outcomes. Examples of theoretical topics may include: consumer search, advertising, dynamic models of collusion and pricing, and bargaining in vertical markets. Examples of econometric topics may include: simulation, semi-parametric, and moment inequalities in relation to problems that arise in industrial organization applications (e.g., entry, product repositioning, transition dynamics, and decision making with computational constraints).
