We find ourselves in the middle of fierce political debates. Should the common folk have political power, or should it be concentrated in the hands of an elite? Is our national interest best served by looking inward and directing our resources toward local concerns, or by thinking globally about both threats and opportunities? How do we balance concerns for economic growth, humanistic understanding, religious freedom, and scientific advancement? Our answers to such questions are enormously consequential, and even people of good will can find themselves in heated disagreement, labeling opponents as the enemy and striving to drive them and their ideas from the public square. The Athenians of 2400 years ago didn't conduct their political battles with tweets and hacks and super PACs, but they would easily recognize our battles as versions of their own, fought over much the same ground.

a particularly heated time, they used the lethal power of the courts to silence Socrates, one of their own. Our task is forensic. We'll assemble the available evidence to determine why the Athenians killed Socrates. His views were complex â€“certainly he doesn't align neatly with any of our own major political parties, and he's difficult to categorize even in the context of ancient Athens. So what was so offensive or threatening about him as to provoke such extreme measures? Once we've assembled our evidence, we'll formally try Socrates in absentia for ourselves. Was he guilty? And what should be done with people who spread dangerous ideas?
