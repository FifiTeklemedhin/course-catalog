Sex and citizenship are two concepts that are not often brought into conversation, as one is thought to be a private, deeply individual matter, while the other concerns the relationship of the individual to a system of governing structures and the wider public in which they are embedded. And yet, when we look at our contemporary world's most divisive public debates –over reproductive rights, immigration, marriage equality, and even people's access to public restrooms –we can't help but notice that sex comprises a vital part of public discourse informing the regulation of people's access to the rights, privileges, and protections of citizenship. This course looks back in time at the ways in which assumptions about so-called "natural" human difference –including but not limited to sex and race –have helped justify regimes of exclusion and control by which some people enjoy full citizenship while others stand outside the boundaries of belonging.
