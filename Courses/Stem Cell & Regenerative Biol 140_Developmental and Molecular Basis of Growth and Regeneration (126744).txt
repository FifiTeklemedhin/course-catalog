Stem Cell & Regenerative Biol 140
Developmental and Molecular Basis of Growth and Regeneration (126744)
Fernando Camargo
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1000 AM - 1129 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
This course will focus on the biology of organ growth and regeneration from a developmental perspective. How is the size and symmetry of our organs set? How does a regenerating animal sense that something is missing and eventually stop the regenerative process when tissues reform? We will learn about conserved developmental pathways that are necessary for adult regeneration and discuss how the aberrant activation of these pathways can lead to overgrowth disorders such as cancer.
Recommended Prep: Life and Physical Sciences A or Life Sciences 1a; Life Sciences 1b; SCRB 10 or MCB 54, or permission of the instructor.
