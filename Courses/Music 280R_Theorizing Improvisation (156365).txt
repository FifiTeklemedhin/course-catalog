The Problem of Presence. This is a cross-disciplinary research seminar in critical improvisation studies, focusing on the three interrelated topics of interest from the last few decades: temporality, embodiment, and improvisation. Their common underlying "discovery" is the very problem of presence. In our studies, recent scholarship in African diasporic music and aesthetics will join a larger conversation on improvisation across multiple areas of inquiry in the arts, the sciences, and the humanities. Through this range of readings, we will examine improvisation as a central feature of individual and collective subjectivities.
