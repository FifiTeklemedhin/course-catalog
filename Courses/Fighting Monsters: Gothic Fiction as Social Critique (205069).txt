Fighting Monsters: Gothic Fiction as Social Critique (205069)
Nicole Suetterlin
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0230 PM - 0429 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
In this seminar we explore how Gothic fiction makes use of the figure of the monster to question social norms. What do vampires, zombies and cyborgs tell us about ourselves and our culture? We begin in the 18th-century, when Enlightened Europe witnessed an unprecedented vampire epidemic. Modern monsters such as the vampire entered the cultural stage at the same time as the core values that have defined Western democracies ever since were taking off: free will, free press, religious tolerance and human equality. What role did literary monsters play in the definition of these ideas? What role do they play today, when these freedoms are in jeopardy? Chasing various monster figures into the 21st century, we explore how their stories reflect the social conflicts of their time and ours. Texts from canonical American, British, French and German authors invite us to understand the perspective of those whom society excludes because they don't fit its norms or they voice dissent. While we will encounter plenty of "classic" monsters, we will investigate the roles of all kinds of societal "others," from madmen, trauma victims, and minorities, to death row inmates. Topics include: media revolutions, use and abuse of technological progress, revolution of sexuality, trauma theory, race, migration, prison politics, surveillance. Materials include film, visual arts, and the natural sciences. Excerpts from select texts by influential cultural theorists will help us to develop the analytical skills necessary to uncover the social critique hidden beneath Gothic fiction's entertaining "chill and thrill" surface.
