This course acknowledges the centuries-long presence of Africans in North America and centers the comparative study of slavery through an analysis of the ways that identity politics (sex, gender, and racial) facilitated the creation of hierarchies while rationalizing the expropriation of millions of enslaved Africans, the violent confiscation of land, and the enfranchisement and indigenization of white settlers. Although drawing upon scholarship from a variety of disciplines, this course centers an examination of the under-explored role of art and visual culture ("high," "low," and popular) within the histories of Transatlantic Slavery and the Black Diaspora. Of particular importance is an analysis of the roles, experiences, and artistic representation of enslaved females and female slave owners. The course will examine various types, styles, genres, and media of art produced in the context of transatlantic slavery across several European empires, paying particular attention to the case of Canada. Although Canada obviously has a deep and complex colonial history, it has "gone missing" from the international dialogue and scholarship which critically examines and challenges these legacies. This course poses the critical question: How did Canada write itself out of the histories of the Black Diaspora and the Transatlantic Slavery of which is was so centrally a part? The machinery of denial is vast and results in the prolific shuttling of Canada's colonial baggage onto other nations (mainly the USA) while generating mythologies of a racially-tolerant, multicultural society.
