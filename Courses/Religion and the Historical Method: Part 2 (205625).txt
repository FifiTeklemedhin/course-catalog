Part 2 of this course serves as a research seminar in which students develop writing projects that apply historical methodologies to religion-related questions. We will collectively workshop outlines and drafts, culminating in an article-length paper approaching publishable quality. Students are strongly encouraged to take Part 1 of the course before enrolling in the research seminar; however, exceptions can be made at the instructor's discretion.
