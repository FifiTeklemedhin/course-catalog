         In this course, we read a highly diverse group of engaging texts in English translation. Most are fictional, mythic, or epic texts. All engage the theme of journey, quest, pilgrimage, passage, or sojourning. We will be attentive to enduring themes and basic questions associated with this varied literature, including parting and return, separation and reintegration, homelessness and homecoming, epic adventure and exploration, trial and suffering, loss and recovery, heroic action, tragedy, pathos, orientation and disorientation, internal and external travel, faith and courage, aesthetic vision, heightened perception, self-discovery and growth, companionship, loneliness, risk, and death. Readings will be selected from among the following: Gilgamesh, J.R.R. Tolkien's Hobbit, Homer's Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, Matsuo Basho's Narrow Road to Oku, Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha, Thomas Mann's Death in Venice, Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would be King, Ashvagosha's Life of the Buddha, Shusaku Endo's Deep River, Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, John Hersey's A Single Pebble, Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain, Fariduddin Attar's Conference of the Birds, Naguib Mahfouz's Journey of Ibn Fattouma, Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Rachel Joyce's The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, and Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities.
