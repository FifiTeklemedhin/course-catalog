          This course will engage in a feminist reading of - texts of Scripture about wo/men in order to reconstruct wo/men's religious history and to assess whether these texts are "good news" for wo/men. Special attention will be given to feminist hermeneutics, and historical reconstruction. Discussion will focus on the significance of social location, critical methods, and historical imagination for the interpretation and significance of these stories about Jewish wo/men and their significance for contemporary religious self-understanding and ministerial praxis. Lectures, group discussions, and group projects seek to foster a participatory democratic style of learning. Note: Course has additional hour to be arranged.
