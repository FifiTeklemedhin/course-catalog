2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 1030 AM - 1229 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 12
This class will cover the fundamentals of model building with a focus on regression, for data gathered from experiments as well as other approaches. The course will move briskly through basic statistics (averages, standard errors) and linear regression then focus on experimental design, model building and causal inference, covering sample size decisions, missing data, model verification and validation, and randomized experiments. Inference will be Bayesian-focused.
