         This class introduces the short screenplay -anywhere from one to thirty formatted pages. Students will learn the basics of this challenging form by viewing short films and reading short screenplays, short stories, and short creative essays.
We'll focus on character and plot in the scripts we develop because many short films-even highly lauded ones-are lacking in these areas. The goal of the course is to write scripts that can actually be produced, so we'll also consider budgetary matters when we're writing.
No prior screenwriting experience is required.
Course Notes: Admission based on submitted samples of writing. For information on specific application requirements, please see the English Department's
