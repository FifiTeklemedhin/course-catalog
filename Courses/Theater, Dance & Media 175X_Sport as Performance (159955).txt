         This course links athletics to the disciplines of theatre, performance studies, sociology, anthropology, and history in order to understand sport as ritual, spectacle, and performance. Our investigations include professional and collegiate team sports, as well as individual athletic performances. The course includes examination of the role of women and how gender is performed in sport both in live events and in the media, as well as the performance of race, class, and nation in sport. A weekly seminar format features lecture, discussion, independent research projects, and guest speakers from the worlds of both athletics and theatre.
