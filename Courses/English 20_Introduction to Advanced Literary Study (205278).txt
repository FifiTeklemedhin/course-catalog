         Meta-issues in literary criticism, with readings in critical, philosophical, and literary texts. The course provides an overview of the theoretical and methodological aspects of what we do when we talk about literature. The goal is not to learn what others have said but to help students orient themselves in the field of literary study. Designed for sophomores interested in concentrating in English or other literature-based fields, but all students are welcome.
