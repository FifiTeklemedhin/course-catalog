2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: TBD Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 10
The Hundred Schools of Thought that flourished during the Warring States period (475 BC â€“221 BC) had a profound influence on Chinese culture and society. This course will examine the four major schools of Chinese thought: Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism. The course begins by introducing the key Confucian ideas and concepts. Then it investigates the Mohist, Daoist, and Legalist response to Confucianism. We conclude by discussing the enduring relevance of these philosophical ideas in modern China.
The course will focus on close readings of the primary texts. All texts will be read in translation, and no prior knowledge of Chinese philosophy is assumed. This is a junior tutorial.
