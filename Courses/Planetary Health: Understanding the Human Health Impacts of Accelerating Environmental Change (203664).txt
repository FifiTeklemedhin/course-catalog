Samuel Myers Christopher Golden
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0300 PM - 0529 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 30
Rapid human population growth and even more rapid growth in consumption are driving a transformation of most of Earth's natural systems including its climate system, its oceans, land cover, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, and coastal and fresh water systems. These systems underpin global food production, our exposure to infectious disease and natural hazards, even the habitability of the places where we live. We will explore the global human health impacts of this transformation of natural systems.
