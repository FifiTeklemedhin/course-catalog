         The course is divided into three thematic sections: first, we will examine how individuals and institutions in the United States perceived the "Third World" and attempted to spur development. We will then move our perspective to the Global South and examine a number of themes that confronted "Third World" states regarding development. Finally, we will turn to recent decades and debates over whether the mechanics of the current global economy generate inequality and whether they could be changed to reduce social, ecological, and economic inequities. We will explore these themes using a mix of texts from memoirs to graphic novels to films to speeches produced by everyone from sweatshop workers to heads of major financial institutions.
