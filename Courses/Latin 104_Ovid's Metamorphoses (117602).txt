             Ovid's witty, exuberant, and learned epic of change and mortality encompasses the history of the world from its creation to the apotheosis of Julius Caesar. This course examines the work's shaping of narrative and myth, its generic multiformity (embracing tragic, elegiac, comic, and pastoral motifs, as well as epic), and its equally complex vision of human existence.
