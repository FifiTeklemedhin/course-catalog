From Wounded Knee to Standing Rock: Indigenous Political Struggle since 1890 (204978)
Christopher Clements
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: W 0100 PM - 0259 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
This course examines Native American history in the twentieth century. We will adopt broad definitions of "political" and "struggle" as we grapple with the history of people whose continued presence in the Americas constitutes a form of political struggle in its own right. The course focuses on key aspects of modern indigenous politics— sovereignty, territory, and decolonization—while also considering broader conceptual questions. What, for example, is the relationship between indigeneity and modernity? Does the twentieth century mark a distinct break from the first four hundred years of Native-settler history? And, how does settler colonialism intersect with other forms of oppression?
