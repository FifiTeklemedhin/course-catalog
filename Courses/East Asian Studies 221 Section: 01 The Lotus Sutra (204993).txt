         Among the Mahayana Buddhist sutras, the "Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of Fine Dharma" (S: Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra) stands as arguably the most influential in terms of its impact on East Asian religion, philosophy,
literature, and visual art. This course will focus on a close reading of several of its twenty-eight fascicles in the original along with supplementary secondary and primary readings in Japanese and Chinese. Weekly examinations of the visual culture of the Lotus Sutra will be a crucial part of the course, as will analyses of poetry and prose works that have been shaped by the Sutra's content and rhetoric. Proficiency in modern and classical Chinese and/or Japanese is preferred.
