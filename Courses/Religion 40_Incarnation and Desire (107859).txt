          The course offers an introduction to Christian thought by considering major texts, figures and ideas from the first century to the present in their changing cultural contexts. Central themes include the categories of body, flesh and soul; free will, desire and sin in relation to divine grace; and the meaning of incarnation. Texts include canonical and non-canonical early Christian literatures, Patristic and medieval texts, Reformation theologies, as well as modern and contemporary authors. Students will develop a sense of the distinguishing features of the Christian world view, while gaining an appreciation for the significant diversity across the tradition
