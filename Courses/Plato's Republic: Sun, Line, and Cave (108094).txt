In Books V-VII of Plato's Republic, Socrates characterizes the philosophers who are to rule in his ideal city. Through a combination of images and argument, he tries to get clear about the objects that an accomplished philosopher would know and understand: namely, Forms and The Good. This portion of the Republic includes the famous analogies of the sun, the line, and the cave. We will read it closely in Greek. In addition to simply reading this beautiful text, we will attend to strengthening our mastery of ancient Greek syntax, and building up a Plato-specific vocabulary.
