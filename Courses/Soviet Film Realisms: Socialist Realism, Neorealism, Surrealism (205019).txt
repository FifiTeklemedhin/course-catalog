What is cinematic realism? What are the most effective techniques and genres for capturing the Soviet reality? From its inception in 1934 Socialist Realism was the dominant aesthetic style of the Soviet cinema. Soviet film, along with other arts aspired to a "historically concrete representation of reality in its revolutionary development." In the course of subsequent fifty years interpretations of this formulation of Socialist Realism led to the development of a variety of "realisms" in Soviet cinema, all alternately representing the Soviet reality in its idealism, stark harshness or humorous absurdity.
This course surveys a broad selection of Soviet films and film realisms (Socialist Realism, Neorealism, Magical Realism, Surrealism) from the 1930s to 1980s. It combines considerations of film form and cinematic technique with the discussion of the ever-difficult concept of realism in art. Students will develop a familiarity with the history of Soviet cinema as well as 'visual literacy' â€“critical vocabulary and analytical tools that will enable them to respond to visual material critically and creatively. The screenings for this course will include musical comedies of Grigori Alexandrov, historical epics of Sergei Eisenstein, surrealist dreamscapes of Andrei Tarkovsky and Tengiz Abuladze as well as absurdist collages of Soviet reality of Kira Muratova among many others.
