In this course, we will explore the psychology of leadership and influence, tackling questions like: How is "good" leadership measured and what are its ingredients? How do cultures, organizations and individuals facilitate or impede the effectiveness of leaders? What allows people to be influential and lead well and ethically under high stress and uncertainty? Can people who lack formal power and status be truly influential? How do cognitive and social biases affect how people lead and are led, influence and are influenced?
