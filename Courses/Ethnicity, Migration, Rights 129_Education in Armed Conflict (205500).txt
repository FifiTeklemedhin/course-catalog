         This course examines the multidimensional and multidirectional relationships between armed conflict and education. How can education contribute to the work of building "lasting peace" in settings of armed conflict globally? How does education reflect inequalities and reinforce social tensions? How does it contribute to stability and reconciliation? What role does it play in shaping individual and collective imaginings of a post-conflict future? Through critical reading of theoretical texts and case studies, engagement with guest speakers, simulations, and other learning tools, we will adopt an action-oriented approach to investigation of these and other questions. We will look beyond the provision of schooling to the learning and teaching that takes place in schools and community settings, and examine the relationships that are at the core of these educational interactions.
