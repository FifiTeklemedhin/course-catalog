       This course surveys the most important results in microeconomics that have shaped the field in the years since WWII. It has two objectives: (i) To understand how the questions were posed, who the innovative researchers were, and what external influences drove them to approach the subject as they did. This 1⁄4of the course is the modern history of micro-economic thought. (ii) The major results themselves. This 3⁄4of the course is quite technical. The lectures will explain and introduce these results in their historical context, and provide the mathematical background. Class participants will present proofs of the results in section.
The major theorems covered come from choice theory under certainty and uncertainty, general equilibrium theory, non-cooperative game theory, cooperative game theory, social choice, and the economics of incentives and mechanism design.
Course requirements comprise three papers and one end-of-term take home exam. Section presentations will also be a component of the grade.
