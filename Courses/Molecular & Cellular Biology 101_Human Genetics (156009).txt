         Genomic information is accelerating the discovery and characterization of the molecular and cellular basis of human health and disease. This new lecture/discussion course will explore how knowledge from new technologies is used to advance our understanding of human biology. Topics will include personal genomics, understanding genome- wide associated studies, epigenetics, gene-environment interactions, and complex traits, the importance of model organisms to investigate molecular mechanisms, and the prospects for cancer genomics and gene/genome therapy. This lecture/discussion course will rely extensively on primary literature and contemporary review articles. Students will actively participate in class discussions and prepare four written summaries of assigned articles and two literature-based research projects (one in the middle of the term and one at the end of the term) that critically assess the scientific basis of popular news articles and consumer-targeted genomics information.
