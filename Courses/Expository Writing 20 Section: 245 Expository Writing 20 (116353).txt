will be abused? Or is there something more fundamentally troubling in the government reading people's emails, or in corporations having records of our internet browsing histories? In the second unit, we will consider government surveillance, specifically the National Security Agency's power to monitor the content of calls and emails originating from non-American citizens who are outside the United States. Do these non-citizens have any privacy rights vis-à-vis the U.S. government? Are there adequate legal protections for American citizens whose communications—both dangerous and innocent—are swept up in surveillance that is targeted at foreigners? In the final unit we will turn to the issue of privacy rights against corporations. Do we have a right to be forgotten online, or should truthful information about private citizens be available via internet search engines indefinitely? Can internet users be regarded as having given meaningful consent to privacy agreements that they have not read and would in any case likely not fully understand? For this unit, students will write a research paper about the appropriate limits on the power that private entities have over our online lives.

Jewish Identity in American Cu
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
What does it mean to be Jewish in America in 2016? At a time when a majority of American Jews do not belong to a synagogue and an estimated one-third of married American Jews are married to non-Jews, is there such a thing as a shared identity among American Jews? This course will examine representations of Jews in American culture in an attempt to understand how Jewish-American culture has evolved since World War II, as well as how shifts in the cultural conversation about minorities in America have affected our conception of Jewish identity. As we consider recent works of literature, art, film, and television, we will question how they challenge and reinforce Jewish stereotypes, and how they continue to shape our ideas

about assimilation, the Holocaust, ethnicity, and religious practice in America. We will begin by examining stories of assimilation by authors including Grace Paley, Allegra Goodman, Philip Roth, Nathan Englander, and others. We will then consider representations of the Holocaust, including Art Spiegelman's Maus, Judy Chicago's Holocaust Project, and Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm "survivor episode." In the final unit of the course, students will choose their own sources as they research and develop their ideas about Jewish identity in American culture.

Drugs, Mind, and War in the Am
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
Psychoactive substances have played an outsized role in the modern history of the Americas. As marijuana is being decriminalized, our class will ask how the Americas have been embroiled in a war on the habits of its peoples. In our first unit, we will consider how the coca leaf, one of the defining symbols of indigenous culture in the Andes, has been transformed into cocaine, an international villain. In the second unit, we will look at the ways in which traffickers adapted to the growing appetites of American consumers in the 1980s and 1990s. Using Bandits, a book by the great 20th century historian, Eric Hobsbawm, we will analyze the social role that drug traffickers have played in their societies. In our final unit, we will ask how the "War on Drugs" has changed the U.S. and Latin America, and consider whether we are currently at a historical watershed in the world's relationship with drugs. As we refine our analytical and writing skills, we will also spend some time on meditation, with the goal of better understanding our own minds, and cultivating concentration and equanimity.
