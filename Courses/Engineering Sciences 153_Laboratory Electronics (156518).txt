 For Undergraduate and Graduate Students
         A lab-intensive introduction to electronic circuit design. Develops circuit intuition and debugging skills through daily hands-on lab exercises, each preceded by class discussion, with minimal use of mathematics and physics. Moves quickly from passive circuits, to discrete transistors, then concentrates on operational amplifiers, used to make a variety of circuits including integrators, oscillators, regulators, and filters. The digital half of the course treats analog- digital interfacing, emphasizes the use of microcontrollers and programmable logic devices (PLDs).

Physics 123 is the same course as Physics 223; if you are a graduate student, please enroll in 223. Two sections will be offered, limited to 20 students per section. Physics 123 is also offered as Engineering Sciences 153. Students may not take both for credit. Undergraduate engineering students should enroll in Engineering Sciences 153. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.
