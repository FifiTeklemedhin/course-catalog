Freshman Seminar 40P

Robin Gottlieb
2017 Fall (1 Credits) Schedule: W 0230 PM - 0429 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 15
What are the goals of mathematics education at the middle and high school level, and how do these goals impact our evaluation of the success or failure of math education in America? Why does math education at these levels matter? What societal structures (historic, economic, political, cultural) impact mathematics education? How does math education in turn impact societal structures? As the world changes, how do the goals of mathematics education change, and in what ways? We will explore these issues to become more educated participants in this ongoing discussion.
