the course, students will write a research paper about an existentialist novel of their choice, examining themes like bad faith, dread, freedom, and authenticity in a classic text by Sartre, De Beauvoir, or Albert Camus, or in a more recent one influenced by that tradition, such as Richard Wright's Black Boy, Walker Percy's The Moviegoer, Kobo Abe's The Face of Another, Tom McCarthy's Remainder, or Kamel Daoud's The Meursault Investigation, among other possibilities.

Food
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
What's for dinner? A seemingly simple question that raises even more. What should we eat? What do we eat? Why do we eat it? How we think about these questions in the context of dining at Harvard is the focus of this course. On the one hand, concerns about the environment or the welfare of animals or our own health might lead us to make deliberate choices about what we eat. On the other hand, less conscious forces –such as habits, how food is presented, culture, innate preferences –might also drive what we eat. In the first unit, we will consider the debate between "sustainable" and "industrialized" farming and ask what that debate can tell us about how we choose what to eat and perhaps how we should choose what to eat. In the second unit, we will take a look at a failed food-related policy aimed at addressing obesity: the ban on large-sized sodas in New York City undertaken a few years ago by then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Using psychology research on eating, decision-making, habits, and behavior change, we will evaluate the policy and think about what lessons we can take away from its failure. In the final unit, students will apply what they have learned about why we eat what we eat to evaluate eating in Harvard's dining halls. Students will select an area of interest to research further and will propose evidence-based changes to the current system. Throughout the course, we will use scientific evidence to inform our thinking about food and

Terrorism or Freedom Fighter
Students must pass one term of Expository Writing 20 to meet the College's Expository Writing requirement.
The saying "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter" long ago entered the realm of cliché', but given that it persists, what does it really mean? How does the international community define terrorism? Does everyone agree on a definition? What causes terrorism? Is religion to blame? How can terrorism be successfully addressed via policy? This course will investigate terrorism through a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods and social science fields. We will begin by discussing the case of the Vietnam War to see how it affects our thinking about one definition of terrorism in circulation today from a recent UN Security Council Resolution. We'll consider the complex evidence of primary sources from the era, including a speech by Martin Luther King Jr. and a documentary from the 1960s with original war footage. Then, we will compare various theories that seek to explain the motivations of terrorists and terrorist organizations. Drawing on ideas from leading scholars in political science, sociology, and psychology, we will weigh in on the debate over whether terrorists are motivated by their "hearts" versus their "brains" as we examine the case of the Islamic State (ISIS). Finally, students will apply what they have learned in the previous units to a specific case that students choose to make an argument about the motivations of, the international response to, and the categorization of a violent political organization. Students will have an opportunity to derive specific policy recommendations based on their argument and findings, thinking through precisely how their research might impact the world around them.
