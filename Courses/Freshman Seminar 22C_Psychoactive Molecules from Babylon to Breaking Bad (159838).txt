Psychoactive molecules change brain function in ways that result in altered perception, mood, or consciousness, and while 'psychoactive' hints at something illicit, examples range from caffeine to cocaine. And psychoactive molecules are also the basis for many useful or potentially useful therapeutic agents: opioids for pain and XTC (MDMA) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After an introductory session, the seminar begins with two meetings focused on foundational principles of brain chemistry: synapses and molecular structure. Subsequent meetings begin with molecules that indirectly influence important neurotransmitters—opioids and cannabinoids— with case studies involving heroin, heroin derivatives like Oxycontin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The cannabinoid meetings will deal with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and anandamide (our body's own cannabinoid). The next few meetings will focus on 'monoamines', especially the naturally occurring monoamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine and the synthetic mimics like amphetamine and methamphetamine. The final meetings will focus on psychedelics (mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin) and designer drugs. The seminars are discussion based and cover wide-ranging issues. For example the seminars on opioids also explore our brain's reward system; the nature of addiction; the connection between opioids, alcohol abuse, and genes; and the connection between opioid sensitivity and human bonding.
Recommended Prep: A familiarity with some basic concepts in biology and chemistry will be helpful but by no means necessary.
