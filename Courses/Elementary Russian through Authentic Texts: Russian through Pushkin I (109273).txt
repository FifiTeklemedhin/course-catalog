Part one of a two part introductory course to Russian language and culture through a selection from the verse and prose works of Russia's greatest poet, Alexander Pushkin (including The Bronze Horseman, excerpts from Eugene Onegin, shorter poems, and prose in The Queen of Spades). This literary and linguistic approach to Elementary Russian has a strong emphasis on reading authentic Russian, but all four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Covers all of the basics of Russian grammar, including all six cases, verbal conjugation, and verbs of motion.
