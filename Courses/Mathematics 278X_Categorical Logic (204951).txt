In the early 1960's, Grothendieck introduced the notion of a topos (a category satisfying certain properties). Topos theory can be regarded as a simultaneous generalization of point-set topology and first-order logic, and has been applied with spectacular success to problems in algebraic geometry. This course will be an introduction to topos theory which emphasizes its connections to mathematical logic (particularly model theory).
