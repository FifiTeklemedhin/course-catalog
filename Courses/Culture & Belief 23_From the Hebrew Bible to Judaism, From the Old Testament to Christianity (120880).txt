Shaye J.D. Cohen
2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: 350
The Hebrew Scriptures, what Christians call the ``Old Testament'' and Jews call the ``Bible,'' are the basis of both Judaism and Christianity. In this course we shall survey how this work of literature, through interpretation and re- interpretation, spawned two different cultural systems. Topics to be surveyed include: canon and prophecy; exegesis and Midrash; Shabbat and Sunday; temple, synagogue, church; the Oral Torah and the Logos; sin and righteousness; messiah and redemption.
Course Notes: This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past.
Class Notes: Occasional Fridays are required. Please check course syllabus for details.
