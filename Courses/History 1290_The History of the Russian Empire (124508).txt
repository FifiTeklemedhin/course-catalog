         The history of Russia from the early days of imperial expansion in the sixteenth century to 1917. Topics include the nature of autocratic authority, Russian Orthodoxy, and the integration of non-Russian peoples and territories. We will explore a wide variety of technologies of imperial rule (mapmaking, censorship, religious policy, ethnographic description), as well as the relationship between subjects of the empire (elites, peasants, and everyone in between) and the built and natural environments they inhabited.
