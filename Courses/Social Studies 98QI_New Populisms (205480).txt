         Thinking the role of the people in politics has long been a topic in the history of political thought. On the one hand, democratic theory is rooted in the people. On the other hand, theorists worry about the consequences of the people behaving badly (that is, as masses, mobs, and multitudes). Together these views suggest that the people themselves are also always potentially the source of their own undoing. However, this thematic ambivalence about the people in the history of political thought differs sharply from more recent articulations of populism as either necessary or detrimental to democracy.This course will compare and contrast views on popular mobilizations in the history of political thought with more recent accounts of populism. Is populism based on a sociological category, a particular political imaginary or something else? Can the relationship between populism and democracy be defined? Readings may include: MuÌˆller (What is Populism?, 2016), Laclau (On Populist Reason, 2007), Moffitt (The Global Rise of Populism, 2016), Grattan (Populism's Power, 2016), Urbanati (Democracy Disfigured, 2014), Zerilli (A Democratic Theory of Judgment, 2016) Rousseau (On the Social Contract), and Arendt, (On Revolution).
