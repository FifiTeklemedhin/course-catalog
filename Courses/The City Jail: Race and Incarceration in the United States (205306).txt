         This course will investigate the conditions of mass incarceration in America through the figure of the municipal jail (which sees on average twelve million admissions annually). We will begin with the question "What is a jail?" and move from there to interrogate the cultural, economic, political and legal forces that shape the conditions of possibility for the 21st century jail. Taking as objects of study both the jail itself and the practice of incarcerating people in local jails, this course will combine scholarly work on U.S. criminal justice with a variety of non-academic texts including legal decisions, contemporary journalism, and documentary film. Over the course of the semester students will learn to "locate" the city jail in a number of different ways: within the complex political and economic structures of the American municipality, within the criminal justice system writ large, and within the country's long history of anti-black racism and struggles for freedom. Students will use the jail itself as a conceptual anchor from which to question the taken-for-granted terms of American practices of captivity
