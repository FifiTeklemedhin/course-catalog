This course invites scholars of religion into sustained engagement with leading theories and methods in the study of history. We will consider first-order questions, principally what it means to think historically and how historical forms of inquiry differ from their alternatives. We will also grapple with more pragmatic concerns, such as how to navigate an archive, how to build a historical argument and how to write in a historical key. We will read influential self- reflective texts by historians, including Joyce Appleby's, et al., Telling the Truth about History and David Hackett Fischers's Historians' Fallacies, as well as materials that explicitly address the relationship of historiographical norms to religion, exemplified by a special issue of Fides et Historia dedicated to that topic. The culminating project for the course will be a research proposal and annotated bibliography for an article-length study in a field of religious history. The course's ventures into the disciplinary questions of history will always be framed in terms of their relevance to the study of religion.
