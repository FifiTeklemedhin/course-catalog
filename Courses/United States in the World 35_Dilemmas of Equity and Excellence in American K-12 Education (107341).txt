Events such as Teach for America's 20th anniversary and films like Waiting for Superman highlight urgent concerns about the quality and reach of American schooling in the 21st century. Against this backdrop, the course grapples with several dilemmas that have defined American K-12 education throughout history. What constitutes educational excellence? Can excellence be achieved for everyone? Why do we have schools and what is their purpose? Given that families, politicians, and the courts often disagree vehemently about the answers to these questions, the course considers who and what will define the future of American education and its role in society.
US-WORLD 35 will be offered twice in Fall 2017 (Tu,Th 10:00- 11:30 and Tu,Th 11:30-1:00). Students must register for and attend only one of the two offerings.
