Instructor Permissions: Instructor
The sixteenth century saw turmoil and
colonization, class warfare, new media, and the seeds of absolutism and nationalism. This course examines major movements of Protestant Reform, focusing on the role of theological arguments in reshaping concepts of power and representation. Why were certain reforms persuasive, and to whom? What were their political and social implicationsâ€”not only for clergy, princes, and merchant-class men, but also peasants, women, Jews, Muslims, intellectuals, and artists? Finally, we will read these histories alongside our present, in which media-driven crisis has become the norm.
