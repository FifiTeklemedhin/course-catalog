How do diet and exercise —both past and present— affect human health? How does an evolutionary medical perspective help make sense of the confusing, often contradictory literature on how factors like sugar, salt, fat, obesity, physical inactivity, high intensity exercise and shoes affect the human body? In this seminar, weekly readings and discussion will be used to explore how ancestral diets and forms of physical activity have shaped human anatomy and physiology, and how differences between past and present diets and forms of exercise may contribute to illness, mortality, and variations in reproductive success. In doing so, we challenge popular conceptions of what it means to be "healthy."
Course Notes: Preference will be given to advanced Harvard undergraduates and FAS graduate students. Enrollment for this course will be capped at 15 students.
Recommended Prep: This course assumes basic knowledge of human evolutionary physiology. LS2 (or equivalent training) is a pre-requisite.
