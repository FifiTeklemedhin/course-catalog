         Since the dawn of the 21st century, we are witnessing a massive migration of images in motion from screening rooms to exhibition spaces, a migration borne along by the digital revolution. This makes it possible, or even necessary, to redefine the cinema beyond the conditions which governed it in the 20th century, that is to say, over and above the restricted spectrum of its history, from a viewpoint expanded to encompass a general history of representations.
