An introduction to descriptive set theory and the study of definable sets of reals. In the context of definable sets of reals it is natural to replace the axiom of choice (AC) with the axiom of determinancy (AD)- the assertion that all infinite, two players perfect information games on integers are determined. Begins with basic framework: Polish spaces, hierarchy of Borel sets, hierarchy of projective sets. Consequences of AD: measurability, perfect set theorem, Baire category. Proof of Borel determinancy. If time permits, relationship with large cardinals: analytic determinancy and measurable cardinals.
