2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Part two of a two-part introductory course in modern Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian (BCS) language and culture, designed for students without previous knowledge who would like to speak BCS or use the language for reading and research. All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Students are exposed to BCS culture through excerpts from poetry, prose, and newspaper articles, as well as video and popular music clips as they learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research.
BCS AA: Elementary BCS I (in the fall) and BCS AB: Elementary BCS II (in the spring) satisfy the foreign language requirement and prepare students for continued study of BCS in intermediate-level courses and for study or travel abroad.
