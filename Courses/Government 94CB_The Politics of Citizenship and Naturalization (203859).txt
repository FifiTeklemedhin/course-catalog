         This course seeks to examine the very different conceptions of citizenship in different states and at different times, particularly through the lens of migration. What does being a citizen of a state mean in a modern sense, and why is it the focus of so much of the current European and American debate over migration? How are policies about who belongs and who becomes a citizen determined? How has naturalization policy changed over time, and how have debates over citizenship and migration changed the overall political system? Multiculturalism and its effects on the citizenship debate are also examined, and the course ends with a look at transnationalism and other phenomenon that may continue to change the nature of migration and citizenship.
