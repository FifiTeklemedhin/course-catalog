This seminar aims to develop an in-depth understanding of modern Democracy's discontent through the Spanish case study in a comparative perspective. In 40 years Spain has turned from being an exemplary model of transition to democracy to a leading example of disaffection with political and economic elites. The Indignados movement and two new political parties (Podemos and Ciudadanos) unexpectedly emerged and within two years have come to govern the largest cities (Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia) and are becoming the most influential political parties in the most important regional governments (Andalucia, Madrid, and Valencia). Is this a model for democratic transformation in Europe? Can citizens really change traditional political party agendas or replace them?
