Microorganisms residing in the human gastrointestinal tract outnumber our own cells and together encode at least 100 times as many unique genes. In this research seminar, we explore gut microbial contributions to human physiology in states of health and disease. We consider the pivotal roles of the gut microbiota in digestion, detoxification, energy regulation, and immunity, and discuss emerging evidence for the microbial modulation of risks and/or treatment of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and behavioral disorders. Students will be introduced to bench and bioinformatics techniques used to investigate gut microbial communities, allowing students to pilot projects that dovetail with topics discussed in seminar.
