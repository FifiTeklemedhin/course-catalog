         Rooted in the writings of both Marx and Foucault, a growing body of scholarship has started to take up the study of biocapital, following its production and circulation across diverse domains, from bioprospecting and drug development to blood banks and organ transplantation to food production and stem cell research. In these ways, this work has started to rethink longstanding themes in anthropology—kinship and citizenship, race and gender, sociality and the self, the relationship between nature, culture, and history—revealing the surprising ways that new forms of marketable knowledge are reworking contemporary lifeworlds. Relating this emerging scholarship to classical readings on capitalism and biopolitics, this course offers an introduction to these novel configurations of knowledge and value. Special attention is paid to relationships between economy and ethics, profit and promise, speculation and subjectivity, life and it definition, and visions of history and the future in the creation and circulation of these new marketable knowledges. We will likewise seek to locate biocapital as much within histories of continuity as those of rupture.
