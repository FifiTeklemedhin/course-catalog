         The history of maps and mapping from the age of Enlightenment to the era of GIS and GeoJSON. We will examine the way states and individuals have used maps to create ideas, shape policies, and generate political and cultural capital. We will also study the production of maps –both print-based and digital –by historians themselves. What new insights about the past can we gain by mapping it? How are innovations in cartographic technology changing the way historians think and write? In today's interactive digital environments, where does the map end and history begin?
