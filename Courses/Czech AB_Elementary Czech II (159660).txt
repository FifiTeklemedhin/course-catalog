All four major communicative skills (speaking, listening comprehension, reading, writing) are stressed. Students are exposed to Czech culture through work with film and literature and gain some familiarity with the major differences between literary and spoken Czech as they learn to use the language both as a means of communication and as a tool for reading and research.
