This course examines urbanization and globalization in East Asia, focusing first on the development of Tokyo as a global city, then turning to the socialist cities of contemporary China, before concluding with an examination of uneven development in Southeast Asian cities. In each section of the course, we will examine how urbanization and globalization affect major social groups (in particular, entrepreneurs and women) who have both propelled and been marginalized by these processes.
