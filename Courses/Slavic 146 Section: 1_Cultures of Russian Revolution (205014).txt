A century ago this fall, Russia was transformed by the allied, twin forces of the October Revolution and modernist art and literature. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed amid nearly universal consensus that the communist project had failed, at a moment when artists and philosophers were declaring the death of modernism in the new age of the postmodern.
This interdisciplinary course will study the intertwined history and continuing legacy of the Russian artistic and political revolutions of 1917. Readings will include theoretical studies and classical texts of revolution and modernism (K. Marx, V. Lenin, L. Trotsky, H. Arendt, P. BuÌˆrger), documentary and historical accounts of the Russian revolution (V. Shklovsky, R. Stites), representations and responses to the October Revolution in art, literature and film from around the globe (S. Eisenstein, D. Rivera, I. Babel, E. Zamyatin), examination of

revolutionary memory and commemoration in later years (G. Orwell, A. Sinyavsky, B. Pasternak, H. Frank), and consideration of the meaning of revolutionary history and practice in the present day (N. Tolokonnikova,
N. Mikhalkov, V. Putin).
