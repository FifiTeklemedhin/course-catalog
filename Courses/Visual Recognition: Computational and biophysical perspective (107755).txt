2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap:
M 0330 PM - 0529 PM n/a
How does cerebral cortex store information, compute and learn? How can we build prosthetic devices to fix or augment brain function? How can we build biologically inspired artificial intelligence? This course will examine these questions in the context of visual cognition. Topics: architecture of visual cortex, neurophysiology, visual consciousness, computational neuroscience, models of pattern recognition and computer vision, artificial intelligence, brain-machine interfaces.
