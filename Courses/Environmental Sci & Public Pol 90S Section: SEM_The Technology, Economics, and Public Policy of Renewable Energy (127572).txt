2018 Spring (4 Credits) Schedule: R 0100 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 50
Energy is the lifeblood of economic activity, and there is little prospect of this changing. However, the planet's stores of easily accessed fossil fuels are limited, and the climatological cost of continuing to rely on fossil fuels is high. This course examines the long run and short run prospects for renewable energy. We start by understanding the technology of hydro, solar, wind, and biomass. We then examine the economics of these technologies, and how subsidies and taxes affect their viability. Special attention will be paid to the interaction of technology, economics, and public policy.
Course Notes: This course will be offered in a seminar format with an enrollment limit of 50. Recommended Prep: Economics 10a.
