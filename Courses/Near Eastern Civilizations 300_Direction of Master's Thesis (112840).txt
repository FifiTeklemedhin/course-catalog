Note: The Doctoral Colloquium will meet throughout the academic year (fall and spring semesters) once every other week. Sessions designed specifically for G1-G2 students, or alternatively, for G3-G4 students (and until approval of the prospectus) will be clearly tagged; assessment (SAT/UNSAT) will be based on attendance of a targeted number of sessions for each level. Required of all G1 and G3 students.
NEC 299A/299B is designed as a year-long course. Students should plan to complete both terms of this course (parts A and B) within the same academic year.
