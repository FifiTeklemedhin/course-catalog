         (1) Bounded rationality: we'll go over a behavioral version of basic microeconomics (consumer theory, Arrow Debreu), basic macroeconomics (real and monetary) and public economics.
(2) Macroeconomics with heterogeneity: we'll study how microeconomic shocks can generate macro fluctuations; network models in macro-finance; models of the income distribution.
(3) Finance: we'll study unified macro-finance models. First, with perfect financial markets: we'll review unified models of stocks, bonds, options and exchange rates. Second, with imperfect financial markets: we'll study how this sheds light on financial crises and currency movements. Time permitting, we'll review some behavioral finance, merging all three themes.The course is geared toward two types of students, and has accordingly two tracks, "behavioral" and "finance", with corresponding emphasis in the homework and exam.
