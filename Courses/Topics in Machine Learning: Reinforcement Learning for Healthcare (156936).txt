Topics in Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning for Healthcare (156936)
Finale Doshi-Velez
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0900 AM - 1029 AM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 20
Sequential decision making is at the core of many healthcare problems: a clinician observes a patient, determines a treatment, and based on the response and the patient's previous history, determines what to try next. Reinforcement learning is a formal framework for thinking about such problems. This course will first cover the fundamentals of reinforcement learning through lectures, readings, and coding assignments. Topics will include Markov decision process and partially observable Markov decision processes, planning under uncertainty, model- free and model-based reinforcement learning, function approximation in reinforcement learning, and batch reinforcement learning. Students will also engage in a semester-long project applying these techniques to clinical decision making in intensive care units.
