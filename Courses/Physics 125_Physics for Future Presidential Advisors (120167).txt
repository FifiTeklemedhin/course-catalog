 Science of the Physical Universe
             Uses physics to analyze important technologies and real world systems. Stresses estimation and "back of the envelope" calculations, as are commonly used by research physicists when addressing new problems and analyzing national and international policy issues. New physical concepts are introduced as necessary. Example topics: energy production and storage (solar, nuclear, batteries), nuclear physics, power and weapons, airplanes, spy satellites, rockets, fluids, health effects of radiation, risk analysis, mechanical design and failure, communication, computation, global warming. Emphasis is on developing physical intuition and the ability to do order-of-magnitude calculations.
