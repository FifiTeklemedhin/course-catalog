Aurality, Listening, and Hearing: Histories. This seminar will put critical pressure on the methods by which Sound Studies. as well as the Music-and-Science mainstream, construct histories of humans and sound, considering two fundamental questions: (a) whether it is possible (or not) to recover the listening or hearing of past historical subjects; and (b) what it means to use sound (or music) as an "epistemic tool." We will discuss the proper domains and/or limits of keyword flashpoints like "auditory knowledge," "listening practices," and "epistemes of acoustics." Making a distinction between aurality and listening on the one hand, and hearing on the other, means delving into the science of physiological hearing, and to that end there will be guest seminars led by faculty from the Harvard Medical School. We will be considering the ideology of deafness, as well as early (nineteenth-century) investigations of aural acuity. Mara Mills (NYU, History of Science, and Disability Studies) will be a guest seminar leader for this section; we will be reading (in advance of the book publication) selected work group papers from the October 2016 conference at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, Testing Hearing. We will also examine assertions that Golden-Age sound technologies such as the phonograph ushered in culturally widespread paradigm changes in listening practices, as part of a general consideration of the feedback loops between technological artifacts and
