         This course focuses on some of the most important if also polarizing European intellectuals of the twentieth century. Writing from roughly the 1920s to the 1960s, the Frankfurt School theorized and critiqued the tumultuous times that they lived through. Fascism, the Holocaust, and capitalist domination, they held, had given the lie to the prevalent myth that the arc of history bent ever toward progress.

cultural criticism. Unlike most of their Marxist predecessors, the Frankfurt School emphasized the role of culture in perpetuating and resisting domination. The study of mundane objects and great art alike, they believed, reveals the nature of domination and hints at the possibility of a world free of it. Course readings will focus on their theorizing of topics such as urban modernity, mass culture, aesthetics, sexuality, individual subjectivity, and the purpose of critique.This course assumes no background in cultural criticism, critical theory, or literary theory.
