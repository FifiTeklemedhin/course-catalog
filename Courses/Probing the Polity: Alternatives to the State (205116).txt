         This course addresses the ways in which people conceive of alternatives to state authority. Ranging from revolutionary ideologies to passive resistance, such frameworks also reflect older ideas that have been buried but not destroyed by state authority. Examples addressed include several from Europe and Asia, and are primarily examined through the prism of local-level ethnography.
