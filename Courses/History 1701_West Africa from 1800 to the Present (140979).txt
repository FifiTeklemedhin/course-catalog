Emmanuel Akyeampong
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 1100 AM - 1159 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
The course explores the internal dynamics of West African states from 1800, and West Africa's relations with the wider world. Innovations in science, technology and finance made the 19th century an era of social and economic opportunity and of political experimentation; a phase curtailed by European imperialism. The course examines African perspectives on colonialism, the two world wars, nationalism, and the transfer of political power. We will review post-colonial political economies and the search for workable political and economic models.
