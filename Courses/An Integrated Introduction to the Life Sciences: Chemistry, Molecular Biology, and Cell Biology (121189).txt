An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology (121189)
Richard Losick Daniel Kahne
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0100 PM - 0229 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
What are the fundamental features of living systems? What are the molecules imparting them and how do their chemical properties explain their biological roles? The answers form a basis for understanding the molecules of life, the cell, diseases, and medicines. In contrast with traditional presentations of relevant scientific disciplines in separate courses, we take an integrated approach, presenting chemistry, molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology framed within central problems such as the biology of HIV and cancer.
