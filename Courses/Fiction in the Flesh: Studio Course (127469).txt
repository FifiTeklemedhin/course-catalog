         In this introduction to fiction filmmaking, we will explore the technical, structural, sensorial, and ontological language of cinema in all its idiomatic, hybrid expressions, from associative assemblages to naturalism. Emphasis will be given to the synesthetic processes of meaning construction, from the seed of an idea to its screen embodiments shot by shot, as well as the relation between sound and image. Projects will be collaborative as well as individual. Occasional in-class workshops by film professionals and artists.
Course Notes: No prior filmmaking experience necessary. Interested students must attend first meeting of class during shopping week to speak with teaching staff
about course enrollment procedure.
