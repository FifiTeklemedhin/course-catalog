Katie Lowe
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MW 0230 PM - 0359 PM Instructor Permissions: Instructor Enrollment Cap: 30
This course will focus on unpacking human development from ages 18 to 29, a period of the life course now known as "emerging adulthood" coined by Dr. Jeffrey Arnett in 2000. Topics explored will include domains of individual development, including cognitive development, mental health, and identity formation, and contexts that influence individual development, including family relationships, education and work settings, and media. Differences between the experience of emerging adulthood in industrialized and developing countries will be incorporated, as well as attention to debunking popularized myths about this period of development.
