2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: MWF 1000 AM - 1059 AM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
An introduction to the fundamental theories of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics and their role in governing the behavior of matter. The course begins with the quantum behavior of a single electron and develops the elements of the periodic table, the nature of the chemical bond, and the bulk properties of materials. Applications include semiconductor electronics, solar energy conversion, medical imaging, and the stability and dynamism of living systems. Calculus will be used extensively.

Additional Course Attributes:
Physical Sciences 11
Physical Sciences 10 and Physical Sciences 11 may be taken in any order. The general chemistry requirement for medical school can be satisfied with any two of the following courses: Life and Physical Sciences A, Life Sciences 1a, Physical Sciences 1, Physical Sciences 10, or Physical Sciences 11. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe.
A strong background in chemistry (Chemistry AP score of 5, or Physical Sciences 1, or equivalent preparation), mathematics at the level of Mathematics 1b (may be taken concurrently), and some familiarity with physics (force, energy, work, and electric charge).
