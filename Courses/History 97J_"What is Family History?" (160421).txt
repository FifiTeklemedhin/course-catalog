Every family has a history; every past actor had a family. This section investigates the practices and purposes of family history. We will explore primary sources such as diaries, child-rearing manuals, and portraits, and survey methods ranging from demography to cultural history to biography. Our topics will include the "invention" of childhood, the meanings of marriage, and the relationship between the household and the state. In addition to tracing the contours of family life across a wide array of times and places, we will investigate the ebbs and flows of family history itself, including the worldwide boom in amateur genealogy today.
