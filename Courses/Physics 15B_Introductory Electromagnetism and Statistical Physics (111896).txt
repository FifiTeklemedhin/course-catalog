TR 1130 AM - 1259 PM n/a
Electricity and magnetism. Topics include electrostatics, electric currents, magnetic field, electromagnetic induction, Maxwell's equations, electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields in materials, and some basic notions in kinetic theory, entropy, temperature, and phase transition associated with electricity and magnetism.
Course Notes:
Recommended Prep:
Principles of Scientific Inquiry (PSI) is the laboratory component of Physics 15b. Students use creative problem-solving in applying theoretical topics to explore physical phenomena and design real life applications. Topics include experimental design, model testing, error analysis, basic programming, introductory circuit analysis, and practical applications of electromagnetism. PSI will meet weekly throughout the semester. This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Science of the Physical Universe or Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, but not both.
Physics 15a, Physics 16, or written permission of the Head Tutor in Physics. Mathematics preparation at least at the level of Mathematics 21a taken concurrently is required. Vector calculus, (div, grad and curl) are used extensively--in principle, this is taught in the course. Students taking
