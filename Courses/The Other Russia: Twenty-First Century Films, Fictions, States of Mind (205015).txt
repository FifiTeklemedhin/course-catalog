Stephanie Sandler
2017 Fall (4 Credits) Schedule: TR 0200 PM - 0329 PM Instructor Permissions: None Enrollment Cap: n/a
Russia is in the news these days for its politics and espionage, but what about the daily lives of Russian people? Nothing gets at that reality in all its pettiness and grandeur better than Russian literature. The stories, poems, plays, movies, memoirs, and documentaries of the last twenty-five years are the subject of this course. We will trace the chaotic transitions of the 1990s, the disparities of wealth and polarized politics of the 2000s, the rise of religious thinking (Orthodox, Islam, Jewish), and the several conflicts at Russia's borders. The impact of travel, diaspora, and the internet on breaking down old walls that once isolated the USSR will be as important as changes in the legal order. The different fates of former Soviet republics will be compared, with examples from Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the far North.
Writers include Svetlana Aleksievich, Joseph Brodsky, Elena Fanailova, Linor Goralik, Alisa Ganieva, Boris Khersonsky, Viktor Pelevin, Liudmila Petrushevskaya, Vladimir Sorokin, and Serhiy Zhadan. Films to include Leviathan, Four, Alexandra, My Joy, and Maidan. Students will also interview and create portraits (visual, verbal, and video) of émigrés from the former Soviet Union living in the Boston area, using the interviews as a context for the cultural representations of life in and beyond Russia.
