Cinema, both documentary and fiction, has throughout its history dealt with the shifting political borders between reality and fiction, truth and fabulation, narrative and politics. This course focuses on two cinema movements from circa 1970, Marginal Cinema in Brazil and Cinema Novo in Portugal, to address the construction of narrative and formal strategies of marginality that were influential in the formation of a contemporary political cinema for the post- truth era.
