          Mining the archives of Harvard's Houghton Theater Collection, this class explores the ways in which contemporary artists interrogate and reanimate of what are often considered to be archaic theatrical genres. This fall, our focus will be 19th Century Melodrama, a popular theatrical genre that traded in stock characters, bombastic performance styles, pedantic moralizing and thrilling special effects.
Following a period of reading and discussion about melodramatic form we will conduct case studies on contemporary projects that mine this history in order to address contemporary cultural concerns. Moving from theory to practice, we will then collaboratively devise a performance project of our own based on our original archival research. This course is for writers, directors, designers and performers willing to work across disciplines.
